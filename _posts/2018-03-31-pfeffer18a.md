title: Structured Factored Inference for Probabilistic Programming
abstract: Probabilistic reasoning on complex real-world models is computationally
  challenging. Inference algorithms have been developed that work well on specific
  models or on parts of general models, but they require significant hand-engineering
  to apply to full-scale problems. Probabilistic programming (PP) enables the expression
  of rich probabilistic models, but inference remains a bottleneck in many applications.
  Factored inference is one of the main approaches to inference in graphical models,
  but has trouble scaling up to some hard problems expressible as probabilistic programs.
  We present structured factored inference (SFI), a framework that enables factored
  inference algorithms to scale to significantly more complex programs. Using models
  encoded in a PP language, SFI provides a sound means to decompose a model into submodels,
  apply an algorithm to each submodel, and combine results to answer a query. Our
  results show that SFI successfully reasons on models where standard factored inference
  algorithms fail due to computational complexity. SFI is nearly as accurate as exact
  inference and is as fast as approximate inference methods.
