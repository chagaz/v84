title: On Statistical Optimality of Variational Bayes
abstract: 'The article  addresses a long-standing open problem on the justification
  of using variational Bayes methods for parameter estimation.  We provide general
  conditions for obtaining optimal risk bounds for point estimates acquired from mean-field
  variational Bayesian inference. The conditions pertain to the existence of certain
  test functions for the distance metric on the parameter space and minimal assumptions
  on the prior.  A general recipe for verification of the conditions is outlined which
  is  broadly applicable to existing Bayesian models with or without latent variables.
  As illustrations,  specific applications to Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Gaussian
  mixture models are discussed. '
