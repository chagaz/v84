title: A Unified Framework for Nonconvex Low-Rank plus Sparse Matrix Recovery
abstract: 'We propose a unified framework to solve general low-rank plus sparse matrix
  recovery problems based on matrix factorization, which covers a broad family of
  objective functions satisfying the restricted strong convexity and smoothness conditions.
  Based on projected gradient descent and the double thresholding operator, our proposed
  generic algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the unknown low-rank and sparse matrices
  at a locally linear rate, while matching the best-known robustness guarantee (i.e.,
  tolerance for sparsity). At the core of our theory is a novel structural Lipschitz
  gradient condition for low-rank plus sparse matrices, which is essential for proving
  the linear convergence rate of our algorithm, and we believe is of independent interest
  to prove fast rates for general superposition-structured models. We illustrate the
  application of our framework through two concrete examples: robust matrix sensing
  and robust PCA. Empirical experiments corroborate our theory.'
