title: Stochastic algorithms for entropy-regularized optimal transport problems
abstract: Optimal transport (OT) distances are finding evermore applications in machine
  learning and computer vision, but their wide spread use in larger-scale problems
  is impeded by their high computational cost. In this work we develop a family of
  fast and practical stochastic algorithms for solving the optimal transport problem
  with an entropic penalization. This work extends the recently developed Greenkhorn
  algorithm, in the sense that, the Greenkhorn algorithm is a limiting case of this
  family. We also provide a simple and general convergence theorem for all algorithms
  in the class, with rates that match the best known rates of Greenkorn and the Sinkhorn
  algorithm, and conclude with numerical experiments that show under what regime of
  penalization the new stochastic methods are faster than the aforementioned methods.
