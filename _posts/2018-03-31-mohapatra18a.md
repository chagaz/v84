title: Learning to Round for Discrete Labeling Problems
abstract: Discrete labeling problems are often solved by formulating them as an integer
  program, and relaxing the integrality constraint to a continuous domain. While the
  continuous relaxation is closely related to the original integer program, its optimal
  solution is often fractional. Thus, the success of a relaxation depends crucially
  on the availability of an accurate rounding procedure. The problem of identifying
  an accurate rounding procedure has mainly been tackled in the theoretical computer
  science community through mathematical analysis of the worst-case. However, this
  approach is both onerous and ignores the distribution of the data encountered in
  practice. We present a novel interpretation of rounding procedures as sampling from
  a latent variable model, which opens the door to the use of powerful machine learning
  formulations in their design. Inspired by the recent success of deep latent variable
  models we parameterize rounding procedures as a neural network, which lends itself
  to efficient optimization via back propagation. By minimizing the expected value
  of the objective of the discrete labeling problem over training samples, we learn
  a rounding procedure that is more suited to the task at hand. Using both synthetic
  and real world data sets, we demonstrate that our approach can outperform the state-of-the-art
  hand-designed rounding procedures.
