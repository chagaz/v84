title: Robust Vertex Enumeration for Convex Hulls in High Dimensions
abstract: 'We design a fast and robust algorithm named {All Vertex Traingle Algorithm
  (AVTA)} for detecting the vertices of the convex hull of a set of points in high
  dimensions. Our proposed algorithm is very general and works for arbitrary convex
  hulls. In addition to being a fundamental problem in computational geometry and
  linear programming, vertex enumeration in high dimensions has numerous applications
  in machine learning. In particular, we apply AVTA to design new practical algorithms
  for topic models and non-negative matrix factorization. For topic models, our new
  algorithm leads to significantly better reconstruction of the topic-word matrix
  than state of the art approaches. Additionally, we provide a robust analysis of
  AVTA and empirically demonstrate that it can handle larger amounts of noise than
  existing methods. For non-negative matrix we show that AVTA is competitive with
  existing methods that are specialized for this task. '
