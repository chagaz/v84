title: Non-parametric estimation of Jensen-Shannon Divergence in Generative Adversarial
  Network training
abstract: 'Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a widely popular framework
  for generative modelling of high-dimensional datasets. However their training is
  well-known to be difficult. This work presents a rigorous statistical analysis of
  GANs providing straight-forward explanations for common training pathologies such
  as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, it proposes a new training objective, Kernel
  GANs and demonstrates its practical effectiveness on large-scale real-world data
  sets. A key element in the analysis is the distinction between training with respect
  to the (unknown) data distribution, and its empirical counterpart. To overcome issues
  in GAN training, we pursue the idea of smoothing the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD)
  by incorporating noise in the input distributions of the discriminator. As we show,
  this effectively leads to an empirical version of the JSD in which the true and
  the generator densities are replaced by kernel density estimates, which leads to
  Kernel GANs. '
