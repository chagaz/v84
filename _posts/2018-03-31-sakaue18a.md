title: Efficient Bandit Combinatorial Optimization Algorithm with Zero-suppressed
  Binary Decision Diagrams
abstract: We consider bandit combinatorial optimization (BCO) problems. A BCO instance
  generally has a huge set of all feasible solutions, which we call the action set.
  To avoid dealing with such huge action sets directly, we propose an algorithm that
  takes advantage of zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams, which encode action
  sets as compact graphs. The proposed algorithm achieves either $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
  with high probability or $O(\sqrt{T})$ expected regret at any $T$-th round. Typically,
  our algorithm works efficiently for BCO problems defined on networks. Experiments
  show that our algorithm is applicable to various large BCO instances including adaptive
  routing problems on real-world networks.
