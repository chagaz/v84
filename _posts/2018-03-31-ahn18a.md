title: Gauged Mini-Bucket Elimination for Approximate Inference
abstract: Computing the partition function Z of a discrete graphical model is a fundamental
  inference challenge. Since this is computationally intractable, variational approximations
  are often used in practice. Recently, so-called gauge transformations were used
  to improve variational lower bounds on Z. In this paper, we propose a new gauge-variational
  approach, termed WMBE-G, which combines gauge transformations with the weighted
  mini-bucket elimination (WMBE) method. WMBE-G can provide both upper and lower bounds
  on Z, and is easier to optimize than the prior gauge-variational algorithm. We show
  that WMBE-G strictly improves the earlier WMBE approximation for symmetric models
  including Ising models with no magnetic field. Our experimental results demonstrate
  the effectiveness of WMBE-G even for generic, nonsymmetric models.
