title: Accelerated Stochastic Power Iteration
abstract: 'Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most powerful tools for
  analyzing matrices in machine learning. In this paper, we study methods to accelerate
  power iteration in the stochastic setting by adding a momentum term. While in the
  deterministic setting, power iteration with momentum has optimal iteration complexity,
  we show that naively adding momentum to a stochastic method does not always result
  in acceleration. We perform a novel, tight variance analysis that reveals a "breaking-point
  variance" beyond which this acceleration does not occur. Combining this insight
  with modern variance reduction techniques yields a simple version of power iteration
  with momentum that achieves the optimal iteration complexities in both the online
  and offline setting. Our methods are embarrassingly parallel and can produce wall-clock-time
  speedups. Our approach is very general and applies to many non-convex optimization
  problems that can now be accelerated using the same technique. '
