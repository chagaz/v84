title: Multi-scale Nystrom Method
abstract: Kernel methods are powerful tools for modeling nonlinear data. However,
  the amount of computation and memory required for kernel methods becomes the bottleneck
  when dealing with large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose Nested Nystrom
  Method (NNM) which achieves a delicate balance between the approximation accuracy
  and computational efficiency by exploiting the multilayer structure and multiple
  compressions. Even when the size of the kernel matrix is very large, NNM consistently
  decomposes very small matrices to update the eigen-decomposition of the kernel matrix.
  We theoretically show that NNM implicitly updates the principal subspace through
  the multiple layers, and also prove that its corresponding errors of rank-k PSD
  matrix approximation and kernel PCA (KPCA) are decreased by using additional sublayers
  before the final layer. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the decreasing property
  of errors of NNM with the additional sublayers through the  experiments on the constructed
  kernel matrices of real data sets, and show that NNM effectively controls the efficiency
  both for rank-k PSD matrix approximation and KPCA.
