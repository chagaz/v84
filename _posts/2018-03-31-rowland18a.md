title: An Analysis of Categorical Distributional Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Distributional approaches to value-based reinforcement learning model the
  entire distribution of returns, rather than just their expected values, and have
  recently been shown to yield state-of-the-art empirical performance. This was demonstrated
  by the recently proposed C51 algorithm, based on categorical distributional reinforcement
  learning (CDRL) [Bellemare et al., 2017]. However, the theoretical properties of
  CDRL algorithms are not yet well understood. In this paper, we introduce a framework
  to analyse CDRL algorithms, establish the importance of the projected distributional
  Bellman operator in distributional RL, draw fundamental connections between CDRL
  and the Cramer distance, and give a proof of convergence for sample-based categorical
  distributional reinforcement learning algorithms.
