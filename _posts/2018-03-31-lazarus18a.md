title: Multiphase MCMC Sampling for Parameter Inference in Nonlinear Ordinary Differential
  Equations
abstract: Traditionally, ODE parameter inference relies on solving the system of ODEs
  and assessing fit of the estimated signal with the observations. However, nonlinear
  ODEs often do not permit closed form solutions. Using numerical methods to solve
  the equations results in prohibitive computational costs, particularly when one
  adopts a Bayesian approach in sampling parameters from a posterior distribution.
  With the introduction of gradient matching, we can abandon the need to numerically
  solve the system of equations. Inherent in these efficient procedures is an introduction
  of bias to the learning problem as we no longer sample based on the exact likelihood
  function. This paper presents a multiphase MCMC approach that attempts to close
  the gap between efficiency and accuracy. By sampling using a surrogate likelihood,
  we accelerate convergence to the stationary distribution before sampling using the
  exact likelihood. We demonstrate that this method combines the efficiency of gradient
  matching and the accuracy of the exact likelihood scheme.
