title: Transfer Learning on fMRI Datasets
abstract: We explore transferring learning between fMRI datasets. A method is introduced
  to improve prediction accuracy on a primary fMRI dataset by jointly learning a model
  using other secondary fMRI datasets. We assume the secondary datasets are directly
  or indirectly linked to the primary dataset through sets of partially shared subjects.
  This method is particularly useful when the primary dataset is small. Using six
  fMRI datasets linked by various subsets of shared subjects, we show that the method
  yields improved performance in various predictive tasks. Our tests are performed
  on a variety of regions of interest in the brain and across various stimuli.
