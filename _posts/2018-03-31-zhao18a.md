title: Stochastic Three-Composite Convex Minimization with a Linear Operator
abstract: We develop a primal-dual convex minimization framework to solve a class
  of stochastic convex three-composite problem with a linear operator. We consider
  the cases where the problem is both convex and strongly convex and analyze the convergence
  of the proposed algorithm in both cases. In addition, we extend the proposed framework
  to deal with additional constraint sets and multiple non-smooth terms. We provide
  numerical evidence on graph-guided sparse logistic regression, fused lasso and overlapped
  group lasso, to demonstrate the superiority of our approach to the state-of-the-art.
