title: Nonlinear Weighted Finite Automata
abstract: Weighted finite automata (WFA) can expressively model functions defined
  over strings but are inherently linear models.Given the recent successes of non-linear
  models in machine learning, it is natural to wonder whether extending WFA to the
  non-linearsetting would be beneficial.In this paper, we propose a novel model of
  neural network based nonlinear WFA model (NL-WFA) along with a learning algorithm.
  Our learning algorithm is inspired by the spectral learning algorithm for WFA and
  relies on a non-linear decomposition of the so-called Hankel matrix, by means of
  an auto-encoder network. The expressive power of NL-WFA and the proposed learning
  algorithm are assessed on both synthetic and real world data, showing that NL-WFA
  can infer complex grammatical structures from data.
