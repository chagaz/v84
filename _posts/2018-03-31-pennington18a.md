title: The emergence of spectral universality in deep networks
abstract: Recent work has shown that tight concentration of the entire spectrum of
  singular values of a deep network’s input-output Jacobian around one at initialization
  can speed up learning by orders of magnitude. Therefore, to guide important design
  choices, it is important to build a full theoretical understanding of the spectra
  of Jacobians at initialization. To this end, we leverage powerful tools from free
  probability theory to provide a detailed analytic understanding of how a deep network’s
  Jacobian spectrum depends on various hyperparameters including the nonlinearity,
  the weight and bias distributions, and the depth. For a variety of nonlinearities,
  our work reveals the emergence of new universal limiting spectral distributions
  that remain concentrated around one even as the depth goes to infinity.
