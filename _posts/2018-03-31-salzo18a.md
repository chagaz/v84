title: Solving lp-norm regularization with tensor kernels
abstract: 'In this paper, we discuss how a suitable family of tensor kernels can be
  used to efficiently solve nonparametric extensions of lp regularized learning methods.
  Our main contribution is proposing a fast dual algorithm, and showing that it allows
  to solve the problem efficiently. Our results contrast recent findings suggesting
  kernel methods cannot be extended beyond Hilbert setting. Numerical experiments
  confirm the effectiveness of the method. '
