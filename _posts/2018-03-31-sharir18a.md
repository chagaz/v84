title: Sum-Product-Quotient Networks
abstract: We present a novel tractable generative model that extends Sum-Product Networks
  (SPNs) and significantly boosts their power. We call it Sum-Product-Quotient Networks
  (SPQNs), whose  core concept is to incorporate conditional distributions into the
  model by direct computation using quotient nodes, e.g. $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A,B)}{P(B)}$.
  We provide sufficient conditions for the tractability of SPQNs that generalize and
  relax the decomposable and complete tractability conditions of SPNs. These relaxed
  conditions give rise to an exponential boost to the expressive efficiency of our
  model, i.e. we prove that there are distributions which SPQNs can compute efficiently
  but require SPNs to be of exponential size. Thus, we narrow the gap in expressivity
  between tractable graphical models and other Neural Network-based generative models.
