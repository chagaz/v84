title: Multimodal Prediction and Personalization of Photo Edits with Deep Generative
  Models
abstract: 'Professional-grade software applications are powerful but complicated –
  expert users can achieve impressive results, but novices often struggle to complete
  even basic tasks. Photo editing is a prime example: after loading a photo, the user
  is confronted with an array of cryptic sliders like "clarity", "temp", and "highlights".
  An automatically generated suggestion could help, but there is no single "correct"
  edit for a given image – different experts may make very different aesthetic decisions
  when faced with the same image, and a single expert may make different choices depending
  on the intended use of the image (or on a whim). We therefore want a system that
  can propose multiple diverse, high-quality edits while also learning from and adapting
  to a user’s aesthetic preferences. In this work, we develop a statistical model
  that meets these objectives. Our model builds on recent advances in neural network
  generative modeling and scalable inference, and uses hierarchical structure to learn
  editing patterns across many diverse users. Empirically, we find that our model
  outperforms other approaches on this challenging multimodal prediction task.'
