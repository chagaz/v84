title: Personalized and Private Peer-to-Peer Machine Learning
abstract: The rise of connected personal devices together with privacy concerns call
  for machine learning algorithms capable of leveraging the data of a large number
  of agents to learn personalized models under strong privacy requirements. In this
  paper, we introduce an efficient algorithm to address the above problem in a fully
  decentralized (peer-to-peer) and asynchronous fashion, with provable convergence
  rate. We show how to make the algorithm differentially private to protect against
  the disclosure of information about the personal datasets, and formally analyze
  the trade-off between utility and privacy. Our experiments show that our approach
  dramatically outperforms previous work in the non-private case, and that under privacy
  constraints, we can significantly improve over models learned in isolation.
