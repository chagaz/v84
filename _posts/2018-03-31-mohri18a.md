title: Competing with Automata-based Expert Sequences
abstract: We consider a general framework of online learning with expert advice where
  regret is defined with respect to sequences of experts accepted by a weighted automaton.
  Our framework covers several problems previously studied, including competing against
  k-shifting experts. We give a series of algorithms for this problem, including an
  automata-based algorithm extending weighted-majority and more efficient algorithms
  based on the notion of failure transitions. We further present efficient algorithms
  based on an approximation of the competitor automaton, in particular n-gram models
  obtained by minimizing the $∞$-Rényi divergence, and present an extensive study
  of the approximation properties of such models. Finally, we also extend our algorithms
  and results to the framework of sleeping experts.
