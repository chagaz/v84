title: Plug-in Estimators for Conditional Expectations and Probabilities
abstract: 'We study plug-in estimators of conditional expectations and probabilities,
  and we provide a systematic analysis of their rates of convergence. The plug-in
  approach is particularly useful in this setting since it introduces a natural link
  to VC- and empirical process theory. We make use of this link to derive rates of
  convergence that hold uniformly  over large classes of functions  and sets, and
  under various conditions. For instance, we demonstrate that elementary conditional
  probabilities  are estimated by these plug-in estimators with a rate of $n^{α-1/2}$
  if one conditions with a VC-class of sets and where $α∈[0,1/2)$ controls a lower
  bound on the size of sets we can estimate given n samples. We gain similar results
  for Kolmogorov’s conditional expectation and  probability which generalize the elementary
  forms of conditioning.  Due to their simplicity, plug-in estimators can be evaluated
  in linear time and there is no up-front cost for inference. '
