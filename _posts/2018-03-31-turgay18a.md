title: Multi-objective Contextual Bandit Problem with Similarity Information
abstract: In this paper we propose the multi-objective contextual bandit problem with
  similarity information. This problem extends the classical contextual bandit problem
  with similarity information by introducing multiple and possibly conflicting objectives.
  Since the best arm in each objective can be different given the context, learning
  the best arm based on a single objective can jeopardize the rewards obtained from
  the other objectives. To handle this issue, we define a new performance metric,
  called the contextual Pareto regret, to evaluate the performance of the learner.
  Essentially, the contextual Pareto regret is the sum of the distances of the arms
  chosen by the learner to the context dependent Pareto front. For this problem, we
  develop a new online learning algorithm called Pareto Contextual Zooming (PCZ),
  which exploits the idea of contextual zooming to learn the arms that are close to
  the Pareto front for each observed context by adaptively partitioning the joint
  context-arm set according to the observed rewards and locations of the  context-arm
  pairs selected in the past. Then, we prove that PCZ achieves $\tilde O (T^{(1+d_p)/(2+d_p)})$
  Pareto regret where $d_p$ is the Pareto zooming dimension that depends on the size
  of the set of near-optimal context-arm pairs. Moreover, we show that this regret
  bound is nearly optimal by providing an almost matching $Î©(T^{(1+d_p)/(2+d_p)})$
  lower bound.
