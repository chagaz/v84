title: Policy Evaluation and Optimization with Continuous Treatments
abstract: We study the problem of policy evaluation and learning from batched contextual
  bandit data when treatments are continuous, going beyond previous work on discrete
  treatments. Previous work for discrete treatment/action spaces focuses on inverse
  probability weighting (IPW) and doubly robust (DR) methods that use a rejection
  sampling approach for evaluation and the equivalent weighted classification problem
  for learning. In the continuous setting, this reduction fails as we would almost
  surely reject all observations. To tackle the case of continuous treatments, we
  extend the IPW and DR approaches to the continuous setting using a kernel function
  that leverages treatment proximity to attenuate discrete rejection. Our policy estimator
  is consistent and we characterize the optimal bandwidth. The resulting continuous
  policy optimizer (CPE) approach using our estimator achieves convergent regret and
  approaches the best-in-class policy for learnable policy classes. We demonstrate
  that the estimator performs well and, in particular, outperforms a discretization-based
  benchmark. We further study the performance of our policy optimizer in a case study
  on personalized dosing based on a dataset of Warfarin patients, their covariates,
  and final therapeutic doses. Our learned policy outperforms benchmarks and nears
  the oracle-best linear policy.
