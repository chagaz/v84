title: 'AdaGeo: Adaptive Geometric Learning for Optimization and Sampling'
abstract: Gradient-based optimization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling can be
  found at the heart of several machine learning methods. In high-dimensional settings,
  well-known issues such as slow-mixing, non-convexity and correlations can hinder
  the algorithmsâ€™ efficiency. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose
  AdaGeo, a preconditioning framework for adaptively learning the geometry of the
  parameter space during optimization or sampling. In particular, we use the Gaussian
  process latent variable model (GP-LVM) to represent a lower-dimensional embedding
  of the parameters, identifying the underlying Riemannian manifold on which the optimization
  or sampling is taking place. Samples or optimization steps are consequently proposed
  based on the geometry of the manifold. We apply our framework to stochastic gradient
  descent, stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, and stochastic gradient Riemannian
  Langevin dynamics, and show performance improvements for both optimization and sampling.
