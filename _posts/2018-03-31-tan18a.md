title: Nested CRP with Hawkes-Gaussian Processes
abstract: There has been growing interest in learning social structure underlying
  interaction data, especially when such data consist of both temporal and textual
  information. In this paper, we propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian model that
  incorporates senders and receivers of messages into a hierarchical structure that
  governs the content and reciprocity of communications. We bring the nested Chinese
  restaurant process from nonparametric Bayesian statistics to Hawkes process models
  of point pattern data. By modeling senders and receivers in such a hierarchical
  framework, we are better able to make inferences about the authorship and audience
  of communications, as well as individual behavior such as favorite collaborators
  and top-pick words. Empirical results with our nonparametric Bayesian point process
  model show that our formulation has improved predictions about event times and clusters.
  In addition, the latent structure revealed by our model provides a useful qualitative
  understanding of the data, facilitating interesting exploratory analyses.
