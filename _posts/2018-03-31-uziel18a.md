title: Growth-Optimal Portfolio Selection under CVaR Constraints
abstract: " Online  portfolio selection research has so  far focused mainly on minimizing
  regret defined in terms of wealth growth. Practical financial decision making, however,
  is deeply concerned with both wealth and risk. We consider online learning of portfolios
  of stocks whose prices are governed by arbitrary (unknown) stationary and ergodic
  processes, where the goal is to maximize wealth while keeping the conditional value
  at risk (CVaR) below a desired threshold. We characterize the asymptomatically optimal
  risk-adjusted performance and  present an investment strategy whose portfolios are
  guaranteed to achieve the asymptotic optimal solution while  fulfilling  the desired
  risk constraint. We also numerically demonstrate and validate the viability of our
  method on standard datasets. "
