title: 'Independently Interpretable Lasso: A New Regularizer for Sparse Regression
  with Uncorrelated Variables'
abstract: 'Sparse regularization such as l1 regularization is a quite powerful and
  widely used strategy for high dimensional learning problems. The effectiveness of
  sparse regularization has been supported practically and theoretically by several
  studies. However, one of the biggest issues in sparse regularization is that its
  performance is quite sensitive to correlations between features. Ordinary l1 regularization
  can select variables correlated with each other, which results in deterioration
  of not only its generalization error but also interpretability. In this paper, we
  pro- pose a new regularization method, “Independently Interpretable Lasso” (IILasso).
  Our proposed regularizer suppresses selecting correlated variables, and thus each
  active variable independently affects the objective variable in the model. Hence,
  we can interpret regression coefficients intuitively and also improve the performance
  by avoiding overfitting. We analyze theoretical property of IILasso and show that
  the proposed method is much advantageous for its sign recovery and achieves almost
  minimax optimal convergence rate. Synthetic and real data analyses also indicate
  the effectiveness of IILasso. '
