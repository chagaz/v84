title: Sparse Linear Isotonic Models
abstract: In machine learning and data mining, linear models have been widely used
  to model the response as parametric linear functions of the predictors. To relax
  such stringent assumptions made by parametric linear models, additive models consider
  the response to be a summation of unknown transformations applied on the predictors;
  in particular, additive isotonic models (AIMs) assume the unknown transformations
  to be monotone. In this paper, we introduce sparse linear isotonic models (SLIMs)
  for high-dimensional problems by hybridizing ideas in parametric sparse linear models
  and AIMs, which enjoy a few appealing advantages over both. In the high-dimensional
  setting, a two-step algorithm is proposed for estimating the sparse parameters as
  well as the monotone functions over predictors. Under mild statistical assumptions,
  we show that the algorithm can accurately estimate the parameters. Promising preliminary
  experiments are presented to support the theoretical results.
