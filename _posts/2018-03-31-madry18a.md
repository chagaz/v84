title: A Fast Algorithm for Separated Sparsity via Perturbed Lagrangians
abstract: 'Sparsity-based methods are widely used in machine learning, statistics,
  and signal processing. There is now a rich class of structured sparsity approaches
  that expand the modeling power of the sparsity paradigm and incorporate constraints
  such as group sparsity, graph sparsity, or hierarchical sparsity. While these sparsity
  models offer improved sample complexity and better interpretability, the improvements
  come at a computational cost: it is often challenging to optimize over the (non-convex)
  constraint sets that capture various sparsity structures. In this paper, we make
  progress in this direction in the context of separated sparsity â€“ a fundamental
  sparsity notion that captures exclusion constraints in linearly ordered data such
  as time series. While prior algorithms for computing a projection onto this constraint
  set required quadratic time, we provide a perturbed Lagrangian relaxation approach
  that computes provably exact projection in only nearly-linear time. Although the
  sparsity constraint is nonconvex, our perturbed Lagrangian approach is still guaranteed
  to find a globally optimal solution. In experiments, our new algorithms offer a
  10x speed-up already on moderately-size inputs.'
