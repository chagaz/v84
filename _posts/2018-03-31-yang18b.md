title: A Simple Analysis for Exp-concave  Empirical  Minimization  with Arbitrary
  Convex Regularizer
abstract: 'In this paper, we present a simple analysis of  fast rates with high probability
  of empirical  minimization for it stochastic composite optimization over a finite-dimensional
  bounded convex set with exponential concave loss functions and  an arbitrary convex
  regularization. To the best of our knowledge, this result is  the first of its kind.
  As a byproduct, we can directly obtain the fast rate  with  high probability for
  exponential concave empirical risk minimization with and without any convex regularization,
  which not only extends existing results of empirical risk minimization but also
  provides a unified framework for analyzing exponential concave empirical  risk minimization
  with and without any convex regularization.  Our proof is very simple only exploiting  the
  covering number of a finite-dimensional bounded set and a concentration inequality
  of random vectors. '
