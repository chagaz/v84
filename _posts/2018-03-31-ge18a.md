title: Minimax-Optimal Privacy-Preserving Sparse PCA in Distributed Systems
abstract: This paper proposes a distributed privacy-preserving sparse PCA (DPS-PCA)
  algorithm that generates a minimax-optimal sparse PCA estimator under differential
  privacy constraints. In a distributed optimization framework, data providers can
  use this algorithm to collaboratively analyze the union of their data sets while
  limiting the disclosure of their private information. DPS-PCA can recover the leading
  eigenspace of the population covariance at a geometric convergence rate, and simultaneously
  achieves the optimal minimax statistical error for high-dimensional data. Our algorithm
  provides fine-tuned control over the tradeoff between estimation accuracy and privacy
  preservation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that DPS-PCA significantly outperforms
  other privacy-preserving PCA methods in terms of estimation accuracy and computational
  efficiency.
