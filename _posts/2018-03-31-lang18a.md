title: Optimality of Approximate Inference Algorithms on Stable Instances
abstract: Approximate algorithms for structured prediction problems—such as LP 
  relaxations and the popular 
  α-expansion algorithm (Boykov et al. 2001)—typically far exceed
  their theoretical performance guarantees on real-world instances. These algorithms
  often find solutions that are very close to optimal. The goal of this paper is to
  partially explain the performance of α-expansion and an LP relaxation algorithm 
  on MAP inference in Ferromagnetic
  Potts models (FPMs). Our main results give stability conditions under which these
  two algorithms provably recover the optimal MAP solution. These theoretical
  results complement numerous empirical observations of good performance.
