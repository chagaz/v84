title: Alpha-expansion is Exact on Stable Instances
abstract: Approximate algorithms for structured prediction problems—such as the popular
  α-expansion algorithm (Boykov et al. 2001) in computer vision—typically far exceed
  their theoretical performance guarantees on real-world instances. These algorithms
  often find solutions that are very close to optimal. The goal of this paper is to
  partially explain the performance of α-expansion on MAP inference in Ferromagnetic
  Potts models (FPMs). Our main results give a stability condition under which the
  α-expansion algorithm provably recovers the optimal MAP solution. This theoretical
  result complements the numerous empirical observations of α-expansion’s performance.
  Additionally, we give a different stability condition under which an LP-based algorithm
  recovers the optimal solution.
