title: Nonparametric Preference Completion
abstract: 'We consider the task of collaborative preference completion: given a pool
  of items, a pool of users and a partially observed item-user rating matrix, the
  goal is to recover the personalized ranking of each user over all of the items.
  Our approach is nonparametric: we assume that each item i and each user u have unobserved
  features x_i and y_u, and that the associated rating is given by $g_u(f(x_i,y_u))$
  where f is Lipschitz and g_u is a monotonic transformation that depends on the user.
  We propose a k-nearest neighbors-like algorithm and prove that it is consistent.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first consistency result for the collaborative
  preference completion problem in a nonparametric setting. Finally, we demonstrate
  the performance of our algorithm with experiments on the Netflix and Movielens datasets. '
