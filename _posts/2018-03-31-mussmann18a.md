title: Generalized Binary Search For Split-Neighborly Problems
abstract: In sequential hypothesis testing, Generalized Binary Search (GBS) greedily
  chooses the test with the highest information gain at each step. It is known that
  GBS obtains the gold standard query cost of O(log n) for problems satisfying the
  k-neighborly condition, which requires any two tests to be connected by a sequence
  of tests where neighboring tests disagree on at most k hypotheses. In this paper,
  we introduce a weaker condition, split-neighborly, which requires that for the set
  of hypotheses two neighbors disagree on, any subset is splittable by some test.
  For four problems that are not k-neighborly for any constant k, we prove that they
  are split-neighborly, which allows us to obtain the optimal O(log n) worst-case
  query cost.
