title: Nonparametric Bayesian sparse graph linear dynamical systems
abstract: A nonparametric Bayesian sparse graph linear dynamical system (SGLDS) is
  proposed to model sequentially observed multivariate data. SGLDS uses the Bernoulli-Poisson
  link together with a gamma process to generate an infinite dimensional sparse random
  graph to model state transitions. Depending on the sparsity pattern of the corresponding
  row and column of the graph affinity matrix, a latent state of SGLDS can be categorized
  as either a non-dynamic state or a dynamic one. A normal-gamma construction is used
  to shrink the energy captured by the non-dynamic states, while the dynamic states
  can be further categorized into live, absorbing, or noise-injection states, which
  capture different types of dynamical components of the underlying time series. The
  state-of-the-art performance of SGLDS is demonstrated with experiments on both synthetic
  and real data.
