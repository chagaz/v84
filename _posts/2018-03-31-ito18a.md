title: 'Online Regression with Partial Information: Generalization and Linear Projection'
abstract: We investigate an online regression problem in which the learner makes predictions
  sequentially while only the limited information on features is observable. In this
  paper, we propose a general setting for the limitation of the available information,
  where the observed information is determined by a function chosen from a given set
  of observation functions. Our problem setting is a generalization of the online
  sparse linear regression problem, which has been actively studied. For our general
  problem, we present an algorithm by combining multi-armed bandit algorithms and
  online learning methods. This algorithm admits a sublinear regret bound when the
  number of observation functions is constant. We also show that the dependency on
  the number of observation functions is inevitable unless additional assumptions
  are adopted. To mitigate this inefficiency, we focus on a special case of practical
  importance, in which the observed information is expressed through linear combinations
  of the original features. We propose efficient algorithms for this special case.
  Finally, we also demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms by simulation
  studies using both artificial and real data.
