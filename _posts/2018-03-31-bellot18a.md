title: Tree-based Bayesian Mixture Model for Competing Risks
abstract: Many chronic diseases possess a shared biology. Therapies designed for patients
  at risk of multiple diseases need to account for the shared impact they may have
  on related diseases to ensure maximum overall well-being. Learning from data in
  this setting differs from classical survival analysis methods since the incidence
  of an event of interest may be obscured by other related competing events. We develop
  a semi-parametric Bayesian regression model for survival analysis with competing
  risks, which can be used for jointly assessing a patient’s risk of multiple (competing)
  adverse outcomes. We construct a Hierarchical Bayesian Mixture (HBM) model to describe
  survival paths in which a patient’s covariates influence both the estimation of
  the type of adverse event and the subsequent survival trajectory through Multivariate
  Random Forests. In addition variable importance measures, which are essential for
  clinical interpretability are induced naturally by our model. We aim with this setting
  to provide accurate individual estimates but also interpretable conclusions for
  use as a clinical decision support tool. We compare our method with various state-of-the-art
  benchmarks on both synthetic and clinical data.
