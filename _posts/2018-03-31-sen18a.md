title: Contextual Bandits with Stochastic Experts
abstract: We consider the problem of contextual bandits with stochastic experts, which
  is a variation of the traditional stochastic contextual bandit with experts problem.
  In our problem setting, we assume access to a class of stochastic experts, where
  each expert is a conditional distribution over the arms given a context. We propose
  upper-confidence bound (UCB) algorithms for this problem, which employ two different
  importance sampling based estimators for the mean reward for each expert. Both these
  estimators leverage information leakage among the experts, thus using samples collected
  under all the experts to estimate the mean reward of any given expert. This leads
  to instance dependent regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}\left(λ(\pmb{μ})\mathcal{M}\log
  T/∆\right)$, where $λ(\pmb{μ})$ is a term that depends on the mean rewards of the
  experts, $∆$ is the smallest gap between the mean reward of the optimal expert and
  the rest, and $\mathcal{M}$ quantifies the information leakage among the experts.
  We show that under some assumptions $λ(\pmb{μ})$ is typically $\mathcal{O}(\log
  N)$. We implement our algorithm with stochastic experts generated from cost-sensitive
  classification oracles and show superior empirical performance on real-world datasets,
  when compared to other state of the art contextual bandit algorithms.
