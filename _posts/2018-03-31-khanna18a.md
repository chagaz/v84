title: 'IHT dies hard: Provable accelerated Iterative Hard Thresholding'
abstract: 'We study – both in theory and practice– the use of momentum motions in
  classic iterative hard thresholding (IHT) methods. By simply modifying plain IHT,
  we investigate its convergence behavior on convex optimization criteria with non-convex
  constraints, under standard assumptions. In diverse scenaria, we observe that acceleration
  in IHT leads to significant improvements, compared to state of the art projected
  gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe variants. As a byproduct of our inspection, we
  study the impact of selecting the momentum parameter: similar to convex settings,
  two modes of behavior are observed –“rippling” and linear– depending on the level
  of momentum.'
