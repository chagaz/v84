title: Metrics for Deep Generative Models
abstract: Neural samplers such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) or generative adversarial
  networks (GANs) approximate distributions by transforming samples from a simple
  random source—the latent space—to samples from a more complex distribution represented
  by a dataset. While the manifold hypothesis implies that a dataset contains large
  regions of low density, the training criterions of VAEs and GANs will make the latent
  space densely covered. Consequently points that are separated by low-density regions
  in observation space will be pushed together in latent space, making stationary
  distances poor proxies for similarity. We transfer ideas from Riemannian geometry
  to this setting, letting the distance between two points be the shortest path on
  a Riemannian manifold induced by the transformation. The method yields a principled
  distance measure, provides a tool for visual inspection of deep generative models,
  and an alternative to linear interpolation in latent space. In addition, it can
  be applied for robot movement generalization using previously learned skills. The
  method is evaluated on a synthetic dataset with known ground truth; on a simulated
  robot arm dataset; on human motion capture data; and on a generative model of handwritten
  digits.
