title: Multi-view Metric Learning in Vector-valued Kernel Spaces
abstract: We consider the problem of metric learning for multi-view data and present
  a novel method for learning within-view as well as between-view metrics in vector-valued
  kernel spaces, as a way to capture multi-modal structure of the data. We formulate
  two convex optimization problems to jointly learn the metric and the classifier
  or regressor in kernel feature spaces. An iterative three-step multi-view metric
  learning algorithm is derived from the optimization problems. In order to scale
  the computation to large training sets, a block-wise Nyström approximation of the
  multi-view kernel matrix is introduced. We justify our approach theoretically and
  experimentally, and show its performance on real-world datasets against relevant
  state-of-the-art methods.
