title: Learning Sparse Polymatrix Games in Polynomial Time and Sample Complexity
abstract: We consider the problem of learning sparse polymatrix games from observations
  of strategic interactions. We show that a polynomial time method based on $\ell_{1,2}$-group
  regularized logistic regression recovers a game, whose Nash equilibria are the $ε$-Nash
  equilibria of the game from which the data was generated (true game), in $O(m^4
  d^4 \log (pd))$ samples of strategy profiles — where $m$ is the maximum number of
  pure strategies of a player, $p$ is the number of players, and $d$ is the maximum
  degree of the game graph. Under slightly more stringent separability conditions
  on the payoff matrices of the true game, we show that our method learns a game with
  the exact same Nash equilibria as the true game. We also show that $Ω(d \log (pm))$
  samples are necessary for any method  to consistently recover a game, with the same
  Nash-equilibria as the true game, from observations of strategic interactions.
