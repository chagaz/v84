title: Direct Learning to Rank And Rerank
abstract: 'Learning-to-rank techniques have proven to be extremely useful for prioritization
  problems, where we rank items in order of their estimated probabilities, and dedicate
  our limited resources to the top-ranked items. This work exposes a serious problem
  with the state of learning-to-rank algorithms, which is that they are based on convex
  proxies that lead to poor approximations. We then discuss the possibility of  "exact"
  reranking algorithms based on mathematical programming. We prove that a relaxed
  version of the "exact" problem has the same optimal solution, and provide an empirical
  analysis.  '
