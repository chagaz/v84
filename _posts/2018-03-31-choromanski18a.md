title: The Geometry of Random Features
abstract: We present an in-depth examination of the effectiveness of radial basis
  function kernel (beyond Gaussian) estimators based on orthogonal random feature
  maps. We show that orthogonal estimators outperform state-of-the-art mechanisms
  that use iid sampling under weak conditions for tails of the associated Fourier
  distributions. We prove that for the case of many dimensions, the superiority of
  the orthogonal transform can be accurately measured by a property we define called
  the charm of the kernel, and that orthogonal random features provide optimal (in
  terms of mean squared error) kernel estimators. We provide the first theoretical
  results which explain why orthogonal random features outperform unstructured on
  downstream tasks such as kernel ridge regression by showing that orthogonal random
  features provide kernel algorithms with better spectral properties than the previous
  state-of-the-art. Our results enable practitioners more generally to estimate the
  benefits from applying orthogonal transforms.
