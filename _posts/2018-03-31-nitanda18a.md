title: 'Gradient Layer: Enhancing the Convergence of Adversarial Training for Generative
  Models'
abstract: 'We propose a new technique that boosts the convergence of training generative
  adversarial networks. Generally, the rate of training deep models reduces severely
  after multiple iterations. A key reason for this phenomenon is that a deep network
  is expressed using a highly non-convex finite-dimensional model, and thus the parameter
  gets stuck in a local optimum. Because of this, methods often suffer not only from
  degeneration of the convergence speed but also from limitations in the representational
  power of the trained network. To overcome this issue, we propose an additional layer
  called the gradient layer to seek a descent direction in an infinite-dimensional
  space. Because the layer is constructed in the infinite-dimensional space, we are
  not restricted by the specific model structure of finite-dimensional models. As
  a result, we can get out of the local optima in finite-dimensional models and move
  towards the global optimal function more directly. In this paper, this phenomenon
  is explained from the functional gradient method perspective of the gradient layer.
  Interestingly, the optimization procedure using the gradient layer naturally constructs
  the deep structure of the network. Moreover, we demonstrate that this procedure
  can be regarded as a discretization method of the gradient flow that naturally reduces
  the objective function. Finally, the method is tested using several numerical experiments,
  which show its fast convergence. '
