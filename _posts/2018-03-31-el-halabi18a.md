title: 'Combinatorial Penalties: Which structures are preserved by convex relaxations?'
abstract: 'We consider the homogeneous and the non-homogeneous convex relaxations
  for combinatorial penalty functions defined on support sets.  Our study identifies
  key differences in the tightness of the resulting relaxations through the notion
  of the lower combinatorial envelope of a set-function along with new necessary conditions
  for support identification. We then propose a general adaptive estimator for convex
  monotone regularizers, and derive new sufficient conditions for support recovery
  in the  asymptotic setting. '
