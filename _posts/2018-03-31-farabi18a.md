title: Efficient Weight Learning in High-Dimensional Untied MLNs
abstract: Existing techniques for improving scalability of weight learning in Markov
  Logic Networks (MLNs) are typically effective  when the parameters of the MLN are
  tied, i.e., several ground formulas in the MLN share the same weight. However, to
  improve accuracy in real-world problems, we typically need to learn separate weights
  for different groundings of the MLN. In this paper, we present an approach to perform
  efficient weight learning in MLNs containing high-dimensional, untied formulas.
  The fundamental idea in our approach is to help the learning algorithm navigate
  the parameter search-space more efficiently by a) tying together groundings of untied
  formulas that are likely to have similar weights, and b) setting good initial values
  for the parameters. To do this, we follow a hierarchical approach, where we first
  learn the parameters that are to be tied using a non-relational learner. We then
  use a relational learner to learn the tied-parameter MLN with initial values derived
  from parameters learned by the non-relational learner. We illustrate the promise
  of our approach on three different real-world problems and show that our approach
  yields much more scalable and accurate results compared to existing state-of-the-art
  relational learning systems.
