title: Nearly second-order optimality of online joint detection and estimation via
  one-sample update schemes
abstract: Sequential hypothesis test and change-point detection when the distribution
  parameters are unknown is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning.
  We show that for such problems, detection procedures based on sequential likelihood
  ratios with simple one-sample update estimates such as online mirror descent are
  nearly second-order optimal. This means that the upper bound for the algorithm performance
  meets the lower bound asymptotically up to a log-log factor in the false-alarm rate
  when it tends to zero. This is a blessing, since although the generalized likelihood
  ratio (GLR) statistics are optimal theoretically, but they cannot be computed recursively,
  and their exact computation usually requires infinite memory of historical data.
  We prove the nearly second-order optimality by making a connection between sequential
  change-point detection and online convex optimization and leveraging the logarithmic
  regret bound property of online mirror descent algorithm. Numerical examples validate
  our theory.
