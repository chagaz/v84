title: A fully adaptive algorithm for pure exploration in linear bandits
abstract: We propose the first fully-adaptive algorithm for pure exploration in linear
  banditsâ€”the task to find the arm with the largest expected reward, which depends
  on an unknown parameter linearly. While existing methods partially or entirely fix
  sequences of arm selections before observing rewards,  our method adaptively changes
  the arm selection strategy based on past observations at each round. We show our
  sample complexity matches the achievable lower bound up to a constant factor in
  an extreme case. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the methods by simulations
  based on both synthetic setting and real-world data, in which our method shows vast
  improvement over existing ones.
