title: Semi-Supervised Learning with Competitive Infection Models
abstract: 'The goal in semi-supervised learning is to effectively combine labeled
  and unlabeled data. One way to do this is by encouraging smoothness across edges
  in a graph whose nodes correspond to input examples. In many graph-based methods,
  labels can be thought of as propagating over the graph, where the underlying propagation
  mechanism is based on random walks or on averaging dynamics. While theoretically
  elegant, these dynamics suffer from several drawbacks which can hurt predictive
  performance. Our goal in this work is to explore alternative mechanisms for propagating
  labels. In particular, we propose a method based on dynamic infection processes,
  where unlabeled nodes can be "infected" with the label of their already infected
  neighbors. Our algorithm is efficient and scalable, and an analysis of the underlying
  optimization objective reveals a surprising relation to other Laplacian approaches.
  We conclude with a thorough set of experiments across multiple benchmarks and various
  learning settings. '
