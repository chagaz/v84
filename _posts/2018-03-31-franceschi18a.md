title: Robustness of classifiers to uniform $\ell_p$ and Gaussian noise
abstract: We study the robustness of classifiers to various kinds of random noise
  models. In particular, we consider noise drawn uniformly from the $\ell_p$ ball
  for $p ∈[1, ∞]$ and Gaussian noise with an arbitrary covariance matrix. We characterize
  this robustness to random noise in terms of the distance to the decision boundary
  of the classifier. This analysis applies to linear classifiers as well as classifiers
  with locally approximately flat decision boundaries, a condition which is satisfied
  by state-of-the-art deep neural networks. The predicted robustness is verified experimentally.
