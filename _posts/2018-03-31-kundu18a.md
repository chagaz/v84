title: 'Convex Optimization over Intersection of Simple Sets: improved Convergence
  Rate Guarantees via an Exact Penalty Approach'
abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a convex function over the intersection
  of finitely many simple sets which are  easy to project onto. This is an important
  problem arising in various domains such as machine learning. The main difficulty
  lies in finding the projection of a point in the intersection of many sets. Existing
  approaches yield an infeasible point with an iteration-complexity of $O(1/ε^2)$
  for nonsmooth problems with no guarantees on the in-feasibility. By reformulating
  the problem through exact penalty functions, we derive first-order algorithms which
  not only guarantees that the distance to the intersection is small but also improve
  the complexity to $O(1/ε)$ and $O(1/\sqrt{ε})$ for smooth functions. For composite
  and smooth problems, this is achieved through a saddle-point reformulation where
  the proximal operators required by the primal-dual algorithms can be computed in
  closed form. We illustrate the benefits of our approach on a graph transduction
  problem and on graph matching.
