title: Online Continuous Submodular Maximization
abstract: In this paper, we consider an online optimization process, where the objective
  functions are not convex (nor concave) but instead belong to a broad class of continuous
  submodular functions. We first propose a variant of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm that
  has access to the full gradient of the objective functions. We show that it achieves
  a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$ (where $T$ is the horizon of the online optimization
  problem) against a $(1-1/e)$-approximation to the best feasible solution in hindsight.
  However, in many scenarios, only an unbiased estimate of the gradients are available.
  For such settings, we then propose an online stochastic gradient ascent algorithm
  that also achieves a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret, albeit against a weaker
  $1/2$-approximation to the best feasible solution in hindsight. We also generalize
  our results to $Î³$-weakly submodular functions and prove the same sublinear regret
  bounds. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms on a few problem
  instances, including non-convex/non-concave quadratic programs, multilinear extensions
  of submodular set functions, and D-optimal design.
