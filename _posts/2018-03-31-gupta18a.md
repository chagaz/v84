title: Exploiting Strategy-Space Diversity for Batch Bayesian Optimization
abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to batch Bayesian optimisation using
  a multi-objective optimisation framework with exploitation and exploration forming
  two objectives. The key advantage of this approach is that it uses a suite of strategies
  to balance exploration and exploitation and thus can efficiently handle the optimisation
  of a variety of functions with small to large number of local extrema. Another advantage
  is that it automatically determines the batch size within a specified budget avoiding
  unnecessary function evaluations. Theoretical analysis shows that the regret not
  only reduces sub-linearly but also by an additional reduction factor determined
  by the batch size. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by optimising
  a variety of benchmark functions, performing hyperparameter tuning of support vector
  regression and classification, and finally heat treatment process of an Al-Sc alloy.
  Comparisons with recent baseline algorithms confirm the usefulness of our algorithm.
