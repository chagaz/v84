title: Graphical Models for Non-Negative Data Using Generalized Score Matching
abstract: A common challenge in estimating parameters of probability density functions
  is the intractability of the normalizing constant. While in such cases maximum likelihood
  estimation may be implemented using numerical integration, the approach becomes
  computationally intensive. In contrast, the score matching method of Hyvärinen (2005)
  avoids direct calculation of the normalizing constant and yields closed-form estimates
  for exponential families of continuous distributions over $\mathbb{R}^m$. Hyvärinen
  (2007) extended the approach to distributions supported on the non-negative orthant
  $\mathbb{R}_+^m$. In this paper, we give a generalized form of score matching for
  non-negative data that improves estimation efficiency. We also generalize the regularized
  score matching method of Lin et al. (2016) for non-negative Gaussian graphical models,
  with improved theoretical guarantees.
