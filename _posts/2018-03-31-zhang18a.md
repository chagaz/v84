title: Nonlinear Structured Signal Estimation in High Dimensions via Iterative Hard
  Thresholding
abstract: We study the high-dimensional signal estimation problem with nonlinear measurements,
  where the signal of interest is either sparse or low-rank. In both settings, our
  estimator is formulated as the minimizer of the nonlinear least-squares loss function
  under a combinatorial constraint, which is obtained efficiently by the iterative
  hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm. Although the loss function is non-convex due
  to the nonlinearity of the statistical model, the IHT algorithm is shown to converge
  linearly to a point with optimal statistical accuracy using arbitrary initialization.
  Moreover, our analysis only hinges on conditions similar to those required in the
  linear case. Detailed numerical experiments are included to corroborate the theoretical
  results.
