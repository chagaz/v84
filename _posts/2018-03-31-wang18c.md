title: Batched Large-scale Bayesian Optimization in High-dimensional Spaces
abstract: 'Bayesian optimization (BO) has become an effective approach for black-box
  function optimization problems when function evaluations are expensive and the optimum
  can be achieved within a relatively small number of queries. However, many cases,
  such as the ones with high-dimensional inputs, may require a much larger number
  of observations for optimization. Despite an abundance of observations thanks to
  parallel experiments, current BO techniques have been limited to merely a few thousand
  observations. In this paper, we propose ensemble Bayesian optimization (EBO) to
  address three current challenges in BO simultaneously: (1)  large-scale observations;
  (2) high dimensional input spaces; and (3) selections of batch queries that balance
  quality and diversity. The key idea of EBO is to operate on an ensemble of additive
  Gaussian process models, each of which possesses a randomized strategy to divide
  and conquer.  We show unprecedented, previously impossible results of scaling up
  BO to tens of thousands of observations within minutes of computation. '
