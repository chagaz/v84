title: Robust Active Label Correction
abstract: Active label correction addresses the problem of learning from input data
  for which noisy labels are available (e.g., from imprecise measurements or crowd-sourcing)
  and each true label can be obtained at a significant cost (e.g., through additional
  measurements or human experts). To minimize these costs, we are interested in identifying
  training patterns for which knowing the true labels maximally improves the learning
  performance. We approximate the true label noise by a model that learns the aspects
  of the noise that are class-conditional (i.e., independent of the input given the
  observed label). To select labels for correction, we adopt the active learning strategy
  of maximizing the expected model change. We consider the change in regularized empirical
  risk functionals that use different pointwise loss functions for patterns with noisy
  and true labels, respectively. Different loss functions for the noisy data lead
  to different active label correction algorithms. If loss functions consider the
  label noise rates, these rates are estimated during learning, where importance weighting
  compensates for the sampling bias. We show empirically that viewing the true label
  as a latent variable and computing the maximum likelihood estimate of the model
  parameters performs well across all considered problems. A maximum a posteriori
  estimate of the model parameters was beneficial in most test cases. An image classification
  experiment using convolutional neural networks demonstrates that the class-conditional
  noise model, which can be learned efficiently, can guide  re-labeling in real-world
  applications.
