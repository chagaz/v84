title: Fast generalization error bound of deep learning from a kernel perspective
abstract: 'We develop a new theoretical framework to analyze the generalization error
  of deep learning, and derive a new fast learning rate for two representative algorithms:
  empirical risk minimization and Bayesian deep learning. The series of theoretical
  analyses of deep learning has revealed its high expressive power and universal approximation
  capability. Our point of view is to deal with the ordinary finite dimensional deep
  neural network as a finite approximation of the infinite dimensional one. Our formulation
  of the infinite dimensional model naturally defines a reproducing kernel Hilbert
  space corresponding to each layer. The approximation error is evaluated by the degree
  of freedom of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space in each layer. We derive the
  generalization error bound of both of empirical risk minimization and Bayesian deep
  learning and it is shown that there appears bias-variance trade-off in terms of
  the number of parameters of the finite dimensional approximation. We show that the
  optimal width of the internal layers can be determined through the degree of freedom
  and derive the optimal convergence rate that is faster than $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ rate
  which has been shown in the existing studies.'
