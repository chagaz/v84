title: Dropout as a Low-Rank Regularizer for Matrix Factorization
abstract: Regularization for matrix factorization (MF) and approximation problems
  has been carried out in many different ways. Due to its popularity in deep learning,
  dropout has been applied also for this class of problems. Despite its solid empirical
  performance, the theoretical properties of dropout as a regularizer remain quite
  elusive for this class of problems. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis
  of dropout for MF, where Bernoulli random variables are used to drop columns of
  the factors. We demonstrate the equivalence between dropout and a fully deterministic
  model for MF in which the factors are regularized by the sum of the product of squared
  Euclidean norms of the columns. Additionally, we inspect the case of a variable
  sized factorization and we prove that dropout achieves the global minimum of a convex
  approximation problem with (squared) nuclear norm regularization. As a result, we
  conclude that dropout can be used as a low-rank regularizer with data dependent
  singular-value thresholding.
