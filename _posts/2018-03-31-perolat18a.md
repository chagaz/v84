title: Actor-Critic Fictitious Play in Simultaneous Move Multistage Games
abstract: Fictitious play is a game theoretic iterative procedure meant to learn an
  equilibrium in normal form games. However, this algorithm requires that each player
  has full knowledge of other players’ strategies. Using an architecture inspired
  by actor-critic algorithms, we build a stochastic approximation of the fictitious
  play process. This procedure is on-line, decentralized (an agent has no information
  of others’ strategies and rewards) and applies to multistage games (a generalization
  of normal form games). In addition, we prove convergence of our method towards a
  Nash equilibrium in both the cases of zero-sum two-player multistage games and cooperative
  multistage games. We also provide empirical evidence of the soundness of our approach
  on the game of Alesia with and without function approximation.
