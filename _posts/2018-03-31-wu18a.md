title: Iterative Spectral Method for Alternative Clustering
abstract: Given a dataset and an existing clustering as input, alternative clustering
  aims to find an alternative partition.  One of the state-of-the-art approaches is
  Kernel Dimension Alternative Clustering (KDAC). We propose a novel Iterative Spectral
  Method (ISM)   that greatly improves the scalability of KDAC. Our algorithm is intuitive,
  relies on easily implementable spectral decompositions, and comes with theoretical
  guarantees.   Its computation time improves upon existing implementations of KDAC
  by as much as 5 orders of magnitude.
