title: 'Accelerated Stochastic Mirror Descent: From Continuous-time Dynamics to Discrete-time
  Algorithms'
abstract: We present a new framework to analyze accelerated stochastic mirror descent
  through the lens of continuous-time stochastic dynamic systems. It enables us to
  design new algorithms, and perform a unified and simple analysis of the convergence
  rates of these algorithms. More specifically, under this framework, we provide a
  Lyapunov function based analysis for the continuous-time stochastic dynamics, as
  well as several new discrete-time algorithms derived from the continuous-time dynamics.
  We show that for general convex objective functions, the derived discrete-time algorithms
  attain the optimal convergence rate. Empirical experiments corroborate our theory.
