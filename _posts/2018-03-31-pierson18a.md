title: Fast Threshold Tests for Detecting Discrimination
abstract: Threshold tests have recently been proposed as a useful method for detecting
  bias in lending, hiring, and policing decisions. For example, in the case of credit
  extensions, these tests aim to estimate the bar for granting loans to white and
  minority applicants, with a higher inferred threshold for minorities indicative
  of discrimination. This technique, however, requires fitting a complex Bayesian
  latent variable model for which inference is often computationally challenging.
  Here we develop a method for fitting threshold tests that is two orders of magnitude
  faster than the existing approach, reducing computation from hours to minutes. To
  achieve these performance gains, we introduce and analyze a flexible family of probability
  distributions on the interval [0, 1] – which we call discriminant distributions
  – that is computationally efficient to work with. We demonstrate our technique by
  analyzing 2.7 million police stops of pedestrians in New York City.
