title: Iterative Supervised Principal Components
abstract: In high-dimensional prediction problems, where the number of features may
  greatly exceed the number of training instances, fully Bayesian approach with a
  sparsifying prior is known to produce good results but is computationally challenging.
  To alleviate this computational burden, we propose to use a preprocessing step where
  we first apply a dimension reduction to the original data to reduce the number of
  features to something that is computationally conveniently handled by Bayesian methods.
  To do this, we propose a new dimension reduction technique, called iterative supervised
  principal components (ISPCs), which combines variable screening and dimension reduction
  and can be considered as an extension to the existing technique of supervised principal
  components (SPCs). Our empirical evaluations confirm that, although not foolproof,
  the proposed approach provides very good results on several microarray benchmark
  datasets with very affordable computation time, and it can also be very useful for
  visualizing high-dimensional data.
