title: Robust Maximization of Non-Submodular Objectives
abstract: We study the problem of maximizing a monotone set function subject to a
  cardinality constraint $k$ in the setting where some number of elements $τ$ is deleted
  from the returned set. The focus of this work is on the worst-case adversarial setting.
  While there exist constant-factor guarantees when the function is submodular, there
  are no guarantees for non-submodular objectives. In this work, we present a new
  algorithm OBLIVIOUS-GREEDY and prove the first constant-factor approximation guarantees
  for a wider class of non-submodular objectives. The obtained theoretical bounds
  are the first constant-factor bounds that also hold in the linear regime, i.e. when
  the number of deletions $τ$ is linear in $k$. Our bounds depend on established parameters
  such as the submodularity ratio and some novel ones such as the inverse curvature.
  We bound these parameters for two important objectives including support selection
  and variance reduction. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the robust performance
  of OBLIVIOUS-GREEDY for these two objectives on various datasets.
