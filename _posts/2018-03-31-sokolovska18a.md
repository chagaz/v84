title: A Provable Algorithm for Learning Interpretable Scoring Systems
abstract: 'Score learning aims at taking advantage of supervised learning to produce
  interpretable models which facilitate decision making. Scoring systems are simple
  classification models that let users quickly perform stratification. Ideally, a
  scoring system is based on simple arithmetic operations, is sparse, and can be easily
  explained by human experts.  In this contribution, we introduce an original methodology
  to simultaneously learn interpretable binning mapped to a class variable, and the
  weights associated with these bins contributing to the score. We develop and show
  the theoretical guarantees for the proposed method. We demonstrate  by numerical
  experiments on benchmark data sets that our approach is competitive compared to
  the state-of-the-art methods. We illustrate by a real medical problem of type 2
  diabetes remission prediction that a scoring system learned automatically purely
  from data is comparable to one manually constructed by clinicians. '
