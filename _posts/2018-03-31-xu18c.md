title: Benefits from Superposed Hawkes Processes
abstract: The superposition of temporal point processes has been studied for many
  years, although the usefulness of such models for practical applications has not
  be fully developed. We investigate superposed Hawkes process as an important class
  of such models, with properties studied in the framework of least squares estimation.
  The superposition of Hawkes processes is demonstrated to be beneficial for tightening
  the upper bound of excess risk under certain conditions, and we show the feasibility
  of the benefit in typical situations. The usefulness of superposed Hawkes processes
  is verified on synthetic data, and its potential to solve the cold-start problem
  of recommendation systems is demonstrated on real-world data.
