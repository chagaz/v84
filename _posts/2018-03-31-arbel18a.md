title: Kernel Conditional Exponential Family
abstract: 'A nonparametric family of conditional distributions is introduced, which
  generalizes conditional exponential families  using functional parameters in a suitable
  RKHS. An algorithm is provided for learning the generalized natural parameter, and  consistency
  of the estimator is established in the well specified case. In experiments, the
  new method generally outperforms a competing approach with consistency guarantees,
  and is competitive with a deep conditional density model on datasets that exhibit
  abrupt transitions and heteroscedasticity.  '
