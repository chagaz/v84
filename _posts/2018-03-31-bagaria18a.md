title: Medoids in Almost-Linear Time via Multi-Armed Bandits
abstract: Computing the medoid of a large number of points in high-dimensional space
  is an increasingly common operation in many data science problems. We present an
  algorithm Med-dit to compute the medoid with high probability, which uses $O(n\log
  n)$ distance evaluations. Med-dit is based on a connection with the Multi-Armed
  Bandit problem. We evaluate the performance of Med-dit empirically on the Netflix-prize
  and single-cell RNA-seq datasets, containing hundreds of thousands of points living
  in tens of thousands of dimensions, and observe a $5$-$10$x improvement in performance
  over the current state of the art. We have released the code of Med-dit and our
  empirical results at https://github.com/bagavi/Meddit.
