title: Combinatorial Preconditioners for Proximal Algorithms on Graphs
abstract: We present a novel preconditioning technique for proximal optimization methods
  that relies on graph algorithms to construct effective preconditioners. Such combinatorial
  preconditioners arise from partitioning the graph into forests. We prove that certain
  decompositions lead to a theoretically optimal condition number. We also show how
  ideal decompositions can be realized using matroid partitioning and propose efficient
  greedy variants thereof for large-scale problems. Coupled with specialized solvers
  for the resulting scaled proximal subproblems, the preconditioned algorithm achieves
  competitive performance in machine learning and vision applications.
