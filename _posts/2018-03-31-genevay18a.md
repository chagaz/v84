title: Learning Generative Models with Sinkhorn Divergences
abstract: 'The ability to compare two degenerate probability distributions, that is
  two distributions supported on low-dimensional manifolds in much higher-dimensional
  spaces, is a crucial factor in the estimation of generative mod- els.It is therefore
  no surprise that optimal transport (OT) metrics and their ability to handle measures
  with non-overlapping sup- ports have emerged as a promising tool. Yet, training
  generative machines using OT raises formidable computational and statistical challenges,
  because of (i) the computational bur- den of evaluating OT losses, (ii) their instability
  and lack of smoothness, (iii) the difficulty to estimate them, as well as their
  gradients, in high dimension. This paper presents the first tractable method to
  train large scale generative models using an OT-based loss called Sinkhorn loss
  which tackles these three issues by relying on two key ideas: (a) entropic smoothing,
  which turns the original OT loss into a differentiable and more robust quantity
  that can be computed using Sinkhorn fixed point iterations; (b) algorithmic (automatic)
  differentiation of these iterations with seam- less GPU execution. Additionally,
  Entropic smoothing generates a family of losses interpolating between Wasserstein
  (OT) and Energy distance/Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) losses, thus allowing to
  find a sweet spot leveraging the geometry of OT on the one hand, and the favorable
  high-dimensional sample complexity of MMD, which comes with un- biased gradient
  estimates. The resulting computational architecture complements nicely standard
  deep network generative models by a stack of extra layers implementing the loss
  function.'
