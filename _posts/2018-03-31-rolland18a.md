title: High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization via Additive Models with Overlapping
  Groups
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular technique for sequential black-box
  function optimization, with applications including parameter tuning, robotics, environmental
  monitoring, and more.  One of the most important challenges in BO is the development
  of algorithms that scale to high dimensions, which remains a key open problem despite
  recent progress.  In this paper, we consider the approach of Kandasamy et al. (2015),
  in which the high-dimensional function decomposes as a sum of lower-dimensional
  functions on subsets of the underlying variables.  In particular, we significantly
  generalize this approach by lifting the assumption that the subsets are disjoint,
  and consider additive models with arbitrary overlap among the subsets.  By representing
  the dependencies via a graph, we deduce an efficient message passing algorithm for
  optimizing the acquisition function.  In addition, we provide an algorithm for learning
  the graph from samples based on Gibbs sampling.  We empirically demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world data.
