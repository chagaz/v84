title: 'Layerwise Systematic Scan: Deep Boltzmann Machines and Beyond'
abstract: 'For Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, one of the greatest discrepancies
  between theory and system is the scan order â€” while most theoretical development
  on the mixing time analysis deals with random updates, real-world systems are implemented
  with systematic scans. We bridge this gap for models that exhibit a bipartite structure,
  including, most notably, the Restricted/Deep Boltzmann Machine. The de facto implementation
  for these models scans variables in a layer-wise fashion. We show that the Gibbs
  sampler with a layerwise alternating scan order has its relaxation time (in terms
  of epochs) no larger than that of a random-update Gibbs sampler (in terms of variable
  updates). We also construct examples to show that this bound is asymptotically tight.
  Through standard inequalities, our result also implies a comparison on the mixing
  times. '
