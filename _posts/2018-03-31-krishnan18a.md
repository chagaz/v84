title: On the challenges of learning with inference networks on sparse, high-dimensional
  data
abstract: We study parameter estimation in Nonlinear Factor Analysis (NFA) where the
  generative model is parameterized by a deep neural network. Recent work has focused
  on learning such models using inference (or recognition) networks; we identify a
  crucial problem when modeling large, sparse, high-dimensional datasets â€“ underfitting.
  We study the extent of underfitting, highlighting that its severity increases with
  the sparsity of the data. We propose methods to tackle it via iterative optimization
  inspired by stochastic variational inference (Hoffman et al., 2013) and improvements
  in the data representation used for inference. The proposed techniques drastically
  improve the ability of these powerful models to fit sparse data, achieving state-of-the-art
  results on a benchmark text-count dataset and excellent results on the task of top-N
  recommendation.
