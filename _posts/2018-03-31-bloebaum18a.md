title: Cause-Effect Inference by Comparing Regression Errors
abstract: We address the problem of inferring the causal relation between two variables
  by comparing the least-squares errors of the predictions in both possible causal
  directions. Under the assumption of an independence between the function relating
  cause and effect, the conditional noise distribution, and the distribution of the
  cause, we show that the errors are smaller in causal direction if both variables
  are equally scaled and the causal relation is close to deterministic. Based on this,
  we provide an easily applicable method that only requires a regression in both possible
  causal directions. The performance of this method is compared with different related
  causal inference methods in various artificial and real-world data sets.
