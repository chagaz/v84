title: Probability–Revealing Samples
abstract: In the most popular distribution testing and parameter estimation model,
  one can obtain information about an underlying distribution D via independent samples
  from D. We introduce a model in which every sample comes with the information about
  the probability of selecting it. In this setting, we give algorithms for problems
  such as testing if two distributions are (approximately) identical, estimating the
  total variation distance between distributions, and estimating the support size.  The
  sample complexity of all of our algorithms is optimal up to a constant factor for
  sufficiently large support size. The running times of our algorithms are near-linear
  in the number of samples collected. Additionally, our algorithms are robust to small
  multiplicative errors in probability estimates. The complexity of our model lies
  strictly between the complexity of the model where only independent samples are
  provided and the complexity of the model where additionally arbitrary probability
  queries are allowed. Our model finds applications where once a given element is
  sampled, it is easier to estimate its probability. We describe two scenarios in
  which all occurrences of each element are easy to explore once at least one copy
  of the element is detected.
