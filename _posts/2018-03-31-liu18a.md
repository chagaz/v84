title: 'Zeroth-Order Online Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers: Convergence
  Analysis and Applications'
abstract: 'In this paper, we design and analyze a new zeroth-order online algorithm,
  namely, the zeroth-order online alternating direction method of multipliers (ZOO-ADMM),
  which enjoys dual advantages of being gradient-free operation and employing the
  ADMM to accommodate complex structured regularizers. Compared to the first-order
  gradient-based online algorithm, we show that ZOO-ADMM requires $\sqrt{m}$ times
  more iterations, leading to a convergence rate of $O(\sqrt{m}/\sqrt{T})$, where
  $m$ is the number of  optimization variables, and $T$ is the number of iterations.
  To accelerate ZOO-ADMM, we propose two minibatch strategies: gradient sample averaging
  and observation averaging, resulting in an improved convergence rate of $O(\sqrt{1+q^{-1}m}/\sqrt{T})$,
  where $q$ is the minibatch size. In addition to convergence analysis, we also demonstrate
  ZOO-ADMM to applications in signal processing, statistics, and machine learning.'
