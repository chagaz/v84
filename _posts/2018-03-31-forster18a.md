title: Can clustering scale sublinearly with its clusters? A variational EM acceleration
  of GMMs and k-means
abstract: 'One iteration of standard k-means (i.e., Lloyd’s algorithm) or standard
  EM for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) scales linearly with the number of clusters
  C, data points N, and data dimensionality D. In this study, we explore whether one
  iteration of k-means or EM for GMMs can scale sublinearly with C at run-time, while
  improving the clustering objective remains effective. The tool we apply for complexity
  reduction is variational EM, which is typically used to make training of generative
  models with exponentially many hidden states tractable. Here, we apply novel theoretical
  results on truncated variational EM to make tractable clustering algorithms more
  efficient. The basic idea is to use a partial variational E-step which reduces the
  linear complexity of O(NCD) required for a full E-step to a sublinear complexity.
  Our main observation is that the linear dependency on C can be reduced to a dependency
  on a much smaller parameter G which relates to cluster neighborhood relations. We
  focus on two versions of partial variational EM for clustering: variational GMM,
  scaling with O(NG²D), and variational k-means, scaling with O(NGD) per iteration.
  Empirical results show that these algorithms still require comparable numbers of
  iterations to improve the clustering objective to same values as k-means. For data
  with many clusters, we consequently observe reductions of net computational demands
  between two and three orders of magnitude. More generally, our results provide substantial
  empirical evidence in favor of clustering to scale sublinearly with C.'
