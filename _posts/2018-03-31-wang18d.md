title: A Stochastic Differential Equation Framework for Guiding Online User Activities
  in Closed Loop
abstract: Recently, there is a surge of interest in using point processes to model
  continuous-time user activities. This framework has resulted in novel models and
  improved performance in diverse applications. However, most previous works focus
  on the ”open loop” setting where learned models are used for predictive tasks. Typically,
  we are interested in the ”closed loop” setting where a policy needs to be learned
  to incorporate user feedbacks and guide user activities to desirable states. Although
  point processes have good predictive performance, it is not clear how to use them
  for the challenging closed loop activity guiding task. In this paper, we propose
  a framework to reformulate point processes into stochastic differential equations,
  which allows us to extend methods from stochastic optimal control to address the
  activity guiding problem. We also design an efficient algorithm, and show that our
  method guides user activities to desired states more effectively than state-of-arts.
