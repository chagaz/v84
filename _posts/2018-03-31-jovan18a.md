title: Efficient Bayesian Methods for Counting Processes in Partially Observable Environments
abstract: When sensors that count events are unreliable, the data sets that result
  cannot be trusted. We address this common problem by developing practical Bayesian
  estimators for a partially observable Poisson process (POPP). Unlike Bayesian estimation
  for a fully observable Poisson process (FOPP) this is non-trivial, since there is
  no conjugate density for a POPP and the posterior has a number of elements that
  grow exponentially in the number of observed intervals. We present two tractable
  approximations, which we combine in a switching filter. This switching filter enables
  efficient and accurate estimation of the posterior. We perform a detailed empirical
  analysis, using both simulated and real-world data.
