title: 'Intersection-Validation: A Method for Evaluating Structure Learning without
  Ground Truth'
abstract: To compare learning algorithms that differ by the adopted statistical paradigm,
  model class, or search heuristic, it is common to evaluate the performance on training
  data of varying size. Measuring the performance is straightforward if the data are
  generated from a known model, the ground truth. However, when the study concerns
  real-world data, the current methodology is limited to estimating predictive performance,
  typically by cross-validation. This work introduces a method to compare algorithmsâ€™
  ability to learn the model structure, assuming no ground truth is given. The idea
  is to identify a partial structure on which the algorithms agree, and measure the
  performance in relation to that structure on subsamples of the data. The method
  is instantiated to structure learning in Bayesian networks, measuring the performance
  by the structural Hamming distance. It is tested using benchmark ground truth networks
  and algorithms that maximize various scoring functions. The results show that the
  method can produce evaluation outcomes that are close to those one would obtain
  if the ground truth was available.
