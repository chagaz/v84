title: Learning Hidden Quantum Markov Models
abstract: 'Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) can be thought of as quantum probabilistic
  graphical models that can model sequential data. We extend previous work on HQMMs
  with three contributions: (1) we show how classical hidden Markov models (HMMs)
  can be simulated on a quantum circuit, (2) we reformulate HQMMs by relaxing the
  constraints for modeling HMMs on quantum circuits, and (3) we present a learning
  algorithm to estimate the parameters of an HQMM from data. While our algorithm requires
  further optimization to handle larger datasets, we are able to evaluate our algorithm
  using several synthetic datasets generated by valid HQMMs. We show that our algorithm
  learns HQMMs with the same number of hidden states and predictive accuracy as the
  HQMMs that generated the data, while HMMs learned with the Baum-Welch algorithm
  require more states to match the predictive accuracy.'
