title: Proximity Variational Inference
abstract: Variational inference is a powerful approach for approximate posterior inference.
  However, it is sensitive to initialization and can be subject to poor local optima.
  In this paper, we develop proximity variational inference (PVI). PVI is a new method
  for optimizing the variational objective that constrains subsequent iterates of
  the variational parameters to robustify the optimization path. Consequently, PVI
  is less sensitive to initial- ization and optimization quirks and finds better local
  optima. We demonstrate our method on four proximity statistics. We study PVI on
  a Bernoulli factor model and sigmoid belief network fit to real and synthetic data
  and compare to deterministic annealing (Katahira et al., 2008). We highlight the
  flexibility of PVI by designing a proximity statistic for Bayesian deep learning
  models such as the variational autoencoder (Kingma and Welling, 2014; Rezende et
  al., 2014) and show that it gives better performance by reducing overpruning. PVI
  also yields improved predictions in a deep generative model of text. Empirically,
  we show that PVI consistently finds better local optima and gives better predictive
  performance.
