title: Labeled Graph Clustering via Projected Gradient Descent
abstract: 'Advances in recovering low-rank matrices from noisy observations have led
  to tractable algorithms for clustering from general pairwise labels with provable
  performance guarantees. Based on convex relaxation, it has been shown that the ground
  truth clusters can be recovered with high probability under a generalized stochastic
  block model by solving a semidefinite program. Although tractable, the algorithm
  is typically too slow for sufficiently large problems in practice. Inspired by recent
  advances in non-convex approaches to low-rank recovery problems, we propose an algorithm
  based on projected gradient descent that enjoys similar provable guarantees as the
  convex counterpart, but can be orders of magnitude faster. Our theoretical results
  are further supported by encouraging empirical results. '
