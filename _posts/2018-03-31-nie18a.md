title: Why Adaptively Collected Data Have Negative Bias and How to Correct for It
abstract: 'From scientific experiments to online A/B testing, the previously observed
  data often affects how future experiments are performed, which in turn affects which
  data will be collected. Such adaptivity introduces complex correlations between
  the data and the collection procedure. In this paper, we prove that when the data
  collection procedure satisfies natural conditions, then sample means of the data
  have systematic negative biases. As an example, consider an adaptive clinical trial
  where additional data points are more likely to be tested for treatments that show
  initial promise. Our surprising result implies that the average observed treatment
  effects would underestimate the true effects of each treatment. We quantitatively
  analyze the magnitude and behavior of this negative bias in a variety of settings.
  We also propose a novel debiasing algorithm based on selective inference techniques.
  In experiments, our method can effectively reduce bias and estimation error. '
