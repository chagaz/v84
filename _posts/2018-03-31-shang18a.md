title: Guaranteed Sufficient Decrease for Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient Optimization
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel sufficient decrease technique for stochastic
  variance reduced gradient descent methods such as SVRG and SAGA. In order to make
  sufficient decrease for stochastic optimization, we design a new sufficient decrease
  criterion, which yields sufficient decrease versions of stochastic variance reduction
  algorithms such as SVRG-SD and SAGA-SD as a byproduct. We introduce a coefficient
  to scale current iterate and to satisfy the sufficient decrease property, which
  takes the decisions to shrink, expand or even move in the opposite direction, and
  then give two specific update rules of the coefficient for Lasso and ridge regression.
  Moreover, we analyze the convergence properties of our algorithms for strongly convex
  problems, which show that our algorithms attain linear convergence rates. We also
  provide the convergence guarantees of our algorithms for non-strongly convex problems.
  Our experimental results further verify that our algorithms achieve significantly
  better performance than their counterparts.
