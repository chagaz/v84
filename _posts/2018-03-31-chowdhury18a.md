title: Parallel and Distributed MCMC via Shepherding Distributions
abstract: In this paper, we present a general algorithmic framework for developing
  easily parallelizable/distributable Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.  Our
  framework relies on the introduction of an auxiliary distribution called a ’shepherding
  distribution’ (SD) that is used to control several MCMC chains that run in parallel.
  The SD is an introduced prior on one or more key parameters (or hyperparameters)
  of the target distribution.  The shepherded chains then collectively explore the
  space of samples, communicating via the shepherding distribution, to reach high
  likelihood regions faster. The method of SDs is simple, and it is often easy to
  develop a shepherded sampler for a particular problem. Other advantages include
  wide applicability- the method can easily be used to draw samples from discrete
  distributions, or distributions on the simplex.  Further, the method is asymptotically
  correct, since the method of SDs trivially maintains detailed balance.
