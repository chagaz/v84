title: 'Gradient Diversity: a Key Ingredient for Scalable Distributed Learning'
abstract: It has been experimentally observed that distributed implementations of
  mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms exhibit speedup saturation
  and decaying generalization ability beyond a particular batch-size. In this work,
  we present an analysis hinting that high similarity between concurrently processed
  gradients may be a cause of this performance degradation. We introduce the notion
  of gradient diversity that measures the dissimilarity between concurrent gradient
  updates, and show its key role in the convergence and generalization performance
  of mini-batch SGD.  We also establish that heuristics similar to DropConnect, Langevin
  dynamics, and quantization, are provably diversity-inducing mechanisms, and provide
  experimental evidence indicating that these mechanisms can indeed enable the use
  of larger batches without sacrificing accuracy and lead to faster training in distributed
  learning. For example, in one of our experiments, for a convolutional neural network
  to reach 95% training accuracy on MNIST, using the diversity-inducing mechanism
  can reduce the training time by 30% in the distributed setting.
