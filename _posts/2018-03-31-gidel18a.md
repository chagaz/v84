title: Frank-Wolfe Splitting via Augmented Lagrangian Method
abstract: Minimizing a function over an intersection of convex sets is an important
  task in optimization that is often much more challenging than minimizing it over
  each individual constraint set. While traditional methods such as Frank-Wolfe (FW)
  or proximal gradient descent assume access to a linear or quadratic oracle on the
  intersection, splitting techniques take advantage of the structure of each sets,
  and only require access to the oracle on the individual constraints. In this work,
  we develop and analyze the Frank-Wolfe Augmented Lagrangian (FW-AL) algorithm, a
  method for minimizing a smooth function over convex compact sets related by a “linear
  consistency” constraint that only requires access to a linear minimization oracle
  over the individual constraints. It is based on the Augmented Lagrangian Method
  (ALM), also known as Method of Multipliers, but unlike most existing splitting methods,
  it only requires access to linear (instead of quadratic) minimization oracles. We
  use recent advances in the analysis of Frank-Wolfe and the alternating direction
  method of multipliers algorithms to prove a sublinear convergence rate for FW-AL
  over general convex compact sets and a linear convergence rate for polytopes.
