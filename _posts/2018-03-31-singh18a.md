title: Minimax Reconstruction Risk of Convolutional Sparse Dictionary Learning
abstract: 'Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) has become a popular method for learning
  parsimonious representations of data, a fundamental problem in machine learning
  and signal processing. While most work on SDL assumes a training dataset of independent
  and identically distributed (IID) samples, a variant known as convolutional sparse
  dictionary learning (CSDL) relaxes this assumption to allow dependent, non-stationary
  sequential data sources. Recent work has explored statistical properties of IID
  SDL; however, the statistical properties of CSDL remain largely unstudied. This
  paper identifies minimax rates of CSDL in terms of reconstruction risk, providing
  both lower and upper bounds in a variety of settings. Our results make minimal assumptions,
  allowing arbitrary dictionaries and showing that CSDL is robust to dependent noise.
  We compare our results to similar results for IID SDL and verify our theory with
  synthetic experiments. '
