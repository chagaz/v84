title: Online Boosting Algorithms for Multi-label Ranking
abstract: 'We consider the multi-label ranking approach to multi-label learning. Boosting
  is a natural method for multi-label ranking as it aggregates weak predictions through
  majority votes, which can be directly used as scores to produce a ranking of the
  labels. We design online boosting algorithms with provable loss bounds for multi-label
  ranking. We show that our first algorithm is optimal in terms of the number of learners
  required to attain a desired accuracy, but it requires knowledge of the edge of
  the weak learners. We also design an adaptive algorithm that does not require this
  knowledge and is hence more practical. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate
  that our algorithms are at least as good as existing batch boosting algorithms. '
