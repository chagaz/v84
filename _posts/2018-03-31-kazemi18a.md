title: Comparison Based Learning from Weak Oracles
abstract: There is increasing interest in learning algorithms that involve interaction
  between hu- man and machine. Comparison-based queries are among the most natural
  ways to get feed- back from humans. A challenge in designing comparison-based interactive
  learning algorithms is coping with noisy answers. The most common fix is to submit
  a query several times, but this is not applicable in many situations due to its
  prohibitive cost and due to the unrealistic assumption of independent noise in different
  repetitions of the same query. In this paper, we introduce a new weak oracle model,
  where a non-malicious user responds to a pairwise comparison query only when she
  is quite sure about the answer. This model is able to mimic the behavior of a human
  in noise-prone regions. We also consider the ap- plication of this weak oracle model
  to the problem of content search (a variant of the nearest neighbor search problem)
  through comparisons. More specifically, we aim at devising efficient algorithms
  to locate a target object in a database equipped with a dissimilarity metric via
  invocation of the weak comparison oracle. We propose two algorithms termed Worcs-I
  and Worcs-II (Weak-Oracle Comparison- based Search), which provably locate the tar-
  get object in a number of comparisons close to the entropy of the target distribution.
  While Worcs-I provides better theoretical guarantees, Worcs-II is applicable to
  more technically challenging scenarios where the algorithm has limited access to
  the ranking dis- similarity between objects. A series of experiments validate the
  performance of our proposed algorithms.
