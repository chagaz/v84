title: 'Tracking the gradients using the Hessian: A new look at variance reducing
  stochastic methods'
abstract: Our goal is to improve variance reducing stochastic methods through better
  control variates. We first propose a modification of SVRG which uses the Hessian
  to track gradients over time, rather than to recondition, increasing the correlation
  of the control variates and leading to faster theoretical convergence close to the
  optimum. We then propose accurate and computationally efficient approximations to
  the Hessian, both using a diagonal and a low-rank matrix. Finally, we demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of problems.
