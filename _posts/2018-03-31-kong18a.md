title: Outlier Detection and Robust Estimation in Nonparametric Regression
abstract: This paper studies outlier detection and robust estimation for nonparametric
  regression problems. We propose to include a subject-specific mean shift parameter
  for each data point such that a nonzero  parameter will identify its corresponding
  data point as an outlier. We adopt a regularization approach by imposing a roughness
  penalty on the regression function and a shrinkage penalty on the mean shift parameter.  An
  efficient algorithm has been proposed to solve the double penalized regression problem.
  We discuss a data-driven simultaneous choice of two regularization parameters based
  on a combination of generalized cross validation and modified Bayesian information
  criterion. We show that the proposed method can consistently detect the outliers.
  In addition,  we obtain minimax-optimal convergence rates for both the regression
  function and the mean shift parameter  under regularity conditions. The estimation
  procedure is shown to enjoy the oracle property in the sense that the convergence
  rates agree with the minimax-optimal rates when the outliers (or regression function)
  are known in advance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method has
  desired performance in identifying outliers under different scenarios.
