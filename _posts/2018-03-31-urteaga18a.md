title: Variational inference for the multi-armed contextual bandit
abstract: In many biomedical, science, and engineering problems, one must sequentially
  decide which action to take next so as to maximize rewards. One general class of
  algorithms for optimizing interactions with the world, while simultaneously learning
  how the world operates, is the multi-armed bandit setting and, in particular, the
  contextual bandit case. In this setting, for each executed action, one observes
  rewards that are dependent on a given ’context’, available at each interaction with
  the world. The Thompson sampling algorithm has recently been shown to enjoy provable
  optimality properties for this set of problems, and to perform well in real-world
  settings. It facilitates  generative and interpretable modeling of the problem at
  hand. Nevertheless, the design and complexity of the model limit its application,
  since one must both sample from the distributions modeled and calculate their expected
  rewards. We here show how these limitations can be overcome using variational inference
  to approximate complex models, applying to the reinforcement learning case advances
  developed for the inference case in the machine learning community over the past
  two decades. We consider contextual multi-armed bandit applications where the true
  reward distribution is unknown and complex, which we approximate with a mixture
  model whose parameters are inferred via variational inference. We show how the proposed
  variational Thompson sampling approach is accurate in approximating the true distribution,
  and attains reduced regrets even with complex reward distributions. The proposed
  algorithm is valuable for practical scenarios where restrictive modeling assumptions
  are undesirable.
