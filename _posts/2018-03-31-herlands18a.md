title: Gaussian Process Subset Scanning for Anomalous Pattern Detection in Non-iid
  Data
abstract: Identifying anomalous patterns in real-world data is essential for understanding
  where, when, and how systems deviate from their expected dynamics. Yet methods that
  separately consider the anomalousness of each individual data point have low detection
  power for subtle, emerging irregularities. Additionally, recent detection techniques
  based on subset scanning make strong independence assumptions and suffer degraded
  performance in correlated data. We introduce methods for identifying anomalous patterns
  in non-iid data by combining Gaussian processes with novel log-likelihood ratio
  statistic and subset scanning techniques. Our approaches are powerful, interpretable,
  and can integrate information across multiple streams. We illustrate their performance
  on numeric simulations and three open source spatiotemporal datasets of opioid overdose
  deaths, 311 calls, and storm reports.
