title: Few-shot Generative Modelling with Generative Matching Networks
abstract: Despite recent advances, the remaining bottlenecks in deep generative models
  are necessity of extensive training and difficulties with generalization from small
  number of training examples. We develop a new generative model called Generative
  Matching Network which is inspired by the recently proposed matching networks for
  one-shot learning in discriminative tasks. By conditioning on the additional input
  dataset, our model can  instantly learn new concepts that were not available in
  the training data but conform to a similar generative process. The proposed framework
  does not explicitly restrict diversity of the conditioning data and also does not
  require an extensive inference procedure for training or adaptation. Our experiments
  on the Omniglot dataset demonstrate that Generative Matching Networks significantly
  improve predictive performance on the fly as more additional data is available and
  outperform existing state of the art conditional generative models.
