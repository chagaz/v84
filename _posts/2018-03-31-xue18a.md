title: Achieving the time of 1-NN, but the accuracy of k-NN
abstract: 'We propose a simple approach which, given distributed computing resources,
  can nearly achieve the accuracy of k-NN prediction, while matching (or improving)
  the faster prediction time of 1-NN. The approach consists of aggregating denoised
  1-NN predictors over a small number of distributed subsamples. We show, both theoretically
  and experimentally, that small subsample sizes suffice to attain similar performance
  as k-NN, without sacrificing the computational efficiency of 1-NN. '
