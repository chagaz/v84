title: A Unified Dynamic Approach to Sparse Model Selection
abstract: Sparse model selection is ubiquitous from linear regression to graphical
  models where regularization paths, as a family of estimators upon the regularization
  parameter varying, are computed when the regularization parameter is unknown or
  decided data-adaptively. Traditional computational methods rely on solving a set
  of optimization problems where the regularization parameters are fixed on a grid
  that might be inefficient. In this paper, we introduce a simple iterative regularization
  path, which follows the dynamics of a sparse Mirror Descent algorithm or a generalization
  of Linearized Bregman Iterations with nonlinear loss. Its performance is competitive
  to glmnet with a further bias reduction. A path consistency theory is presented
  that under the Restricted Strong Convexity and the Irrepresentable Condition, the
  path will first evolve in a subspace with no false positives and reach an estimator
  that is sign-consistent or of minimax optimal $\ell_2$ error rate. Early stopping
  regularization is required to prevent overfitting. Application examples are given
  in sparse logistic regression and Ising models for NIPS coauthorship.
