title: Towards Provable Learning of Polynomial Neural Networks Using Low-Rank Matrix
  Estimation
abstract: We study the problem of (provably) learning the weights of a two-layer neural
  network with quadratic activations. In particular, we focus on the under-parametrized
  regime where the number of neurons in the hidden layer is (much) smaller than the
  dimension of the input. Our approach uses a lifting trick, which enables us to borrow
  algorithmic ideas from low-rank matrix estimation. In this context, we propose two
  novel, non-convex training algorithms which do not need any extra tuning parameters
  other than the number of hidden neurons. We support our algorithms with rigorous
  theoretical analysis, and show that the proposed algorithms enjoy linear convergence,
  fast running time per iteration, and near-optimal sample complexity. Finally, we
  complement our theoretical results with several numerical experiments.
