title: Crowdclustering with Partition Labels
abstract: Crowdclustering is a practical way to incorporate domain knowledge into
  clustering, by combining opinions from multiple domain experts. Existing crowdclustering
  methods analyze binary pairwise similarity labels. However, in some applications,
  experts might provide partition labels. If we convert partition labels into pairwise
  similarity, then it would be difficult to understand the relationships between clustering
  solutions from different experts. In this paper, we propose a crowdclustering model
  that directly analyzes partition labels. The proposed model adopts a novel approach
  based on a modified multinomial logistic regression model, which simultaneously
  learns the number of clusters and determines hyper-planes that partition samples
  into clusters. The proposed model also learns a mapping between the latent clusters
  and expert labels, revealing the agreements and disagreements between experts. Experiments
  on benchmark data demonstrate that the proposed model simultaneously learns the
  number of clusters and discovers the clustering structure. An experiment on disease
  subtyping problem illustrates that the proposed model helps us understand the agreement
  and disagreement between experts.
