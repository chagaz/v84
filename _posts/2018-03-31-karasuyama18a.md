title: Factor Analysis on a Graph
abstract: Graph is a common way to represent relationships among a set of objects
  in a variety of application areas of machine learning. We consider the case that
  the input data is not only a graph but also numerical features in which one of the
  given features corresponds to a node in the graph. Then, the primary importance
  is often in understanding interactions on the graph nodes which effect on covariance
  structure of the numerical features. We propose a Gaussian based analysis which
  is a combination of graph constrained covariance matrix estimation and factor analysis
  (FA). We show that this approach, called graph FA, has desirable interpretability.
  In particular, we prove the connection between graph FA and a graph node clustering
  based on a perspective of kernel method. This connection indicates that graph FA
  is effective not only on the conventional noise-reduction explanation of the observation
  by FA but also on identifying important subgraphs. The experiments on synthetic
  and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
