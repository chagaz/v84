title: Learning Determinantal Point Processes in Sublinear Time
abstract: We propose a new class of determinantal point processes (DPPs) which can
  be manipulated for inference and parameter learning in potentially sublinear time
  in the number of items. This class, based on a specific low-rank factorization of
  the marginal kernel, is particularly suited to a subclass of continuous DPPs  and
  DPPs defined on exponentially many items. We apply this new class to modelling text
  documents as sampling a DPP of sentences, and propose a conditional maximum likelihood
  formulation to model topic proportions, which is made possible with no approximation
  for our class of DPPs. We present an application to document summarization with
  a DPP on 2 to the power 500 items.
