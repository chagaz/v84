title: SDCA-Powered Inexact Dual Augmented Lagrangian Method for Fast CRF Learning
abstract: We propose an efficient dual augmented Lagrangian formulation to learn conditional
  random fields (CRF). Our algorithm, which can be interpreted as an inexact gradient
  descent algorithm on the multipliers, does not require to perform global inference
  iteratively and requires only a fixed number of stochastic clique-wise updates at
  each epoch to obtain a sufficiently good estimate of the gradient w.r.t. the Lagrange
  multipliers. We prove that the proposed algorithm enjoys global linear convergence
  for both the primal and the dual objectives. Our experiments show that the proposed
  algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of the speed of convergence.
