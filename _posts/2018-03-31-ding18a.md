title: Bayesian Nonparametric Poisson-Process Allocation for Time-Sequence Modeling
abstract: Analyzing the underlying structure of multiple time-sequences provides insights
  into the understanding of social networks and human activities. In this work, we
  present the Bayesian nonparametric Poisson process allocation (BaNPPA), a latent-function
  model for time-sequences, which  automatically infers the number of latent functions.
  We model the intensity of each sequence as an infinite mixture of latent functions,
  each of which is obtained using a function drawn from a Gaussian process. We show
  that a technical challenge for the inference of such mixture models is the unidentifiability
  of the weights of the latent functions. We propose to cope with the issue by regulating
  the volume of each latent function within a variational inference algorithm. Our
  algorithm is computationally efficient and scales well to large data sets. We demonstrate
  the usefulness of our proposed model through experiments on both synthetic and real-world
  data sets.
