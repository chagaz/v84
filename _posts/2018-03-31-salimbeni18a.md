title: 'Natural Gradients in Practice: Non-Conjugate Variational Inference in Gaussian
  Process Models'
abstract: 'The natural gradient method has been used effectively in conjugate Gaussian
  process models, but the non-conjugate case has been largely unexplored. We examine
  how natural gradients can be used in non-conjugate stochastic settings, together
  with hyperparameter learning. We conclude that the natural gradient can significantly
  improve performance in terms of wall-clock time. For ill-conditioned posteriors
  the benefit of the natural gradient method is especially pronounced, and we demonstrate
  a practical setting where ordinary gradients are unusable. We show how natural gradients
  can be computed efficiently and automatically in any parameterization, using automatic
  differentiation. '
