title: 'FLAG n’ FLARE: Fast Linearly-Coupled Adaptive Gradient Methods'
abstract: We consider first order gradient methods for effectively optimizing a composite
  objective in the form of a sum of smooth and, potentially, non-smooth functions.
  We present accelerated and adaptive gradient methods, called FLAG and FLARE, which
  can offer the best of both worlds. They can achieve the optimal convergence rate
  by attaining the optimal first-order oracle complexity for smooth convex optimization.
  Additionally, they can adaptively and non-uniformly re-scale the gradient direction
  to adapt to the limited curvature available and conform to the geometry of the domain.
  We show theoretically and empirically that, through the compounding effects of acceleration
  and adaptivity, FLAG and FLARE can be highly effective for many data fitting and
  machine learning applications.
