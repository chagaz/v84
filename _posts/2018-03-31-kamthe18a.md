title: Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Probabilistic Model Predictive Control
abstract: " Trial-and-error based reinforcement learning (RL) has seen rapid advancements
  in recent times, especially with the advent of deep neural networks. However, the
  majority of autonomous RL algorithms require a large number of interactions with
  the environment. A large number of interactions may be impractical in many real-world
  applications, such as robotics, and many practical systems have to obey limitations
  in the form of state space or control constraints. To reduce the number of system
  interactions while simultaneously handling constraints, we propose a model-based
  RL framework based on probabilistic Model Predictive Control (MPC). In particular,
  we propose to learn a probabilistic transition model using Gaussian Processes (GPs)
  to incorporate model uncertainty into long-term predictions, thereby, reducing the
  impact of model errors. We then use MPC to find a control sequence that minimises
  the expected long-term cost. We provide theoretical guarantees for first-order optimality
  in the GP-based transition models with deterministic approximate inference for long-term
  planning. We demonstrate that our approach does not only achieve state-of-the-art
  data efficiency, but also is a principled way for RL in constrained environments."
