title: On Truly Block Eigensolvers via Riemannian Optimization
abstract: We study theoretical properties of block solvers for the eigenvalue problem.
  Despite a recent surge of interest in such eigensolver analysis, truly block solvers
  have received relatively less attention, in contrast to the majority of studies
  concentrating on vector versions and non-truly block versions that rely on the deflation
  strategy. In fact, truly block solvers are more widely deployed in practice by virtue
  of its simplicity without compromise on accuracy. However, the corresponding theoretical
  analysis remains inadequate for first-order solvers, as only local and k-th gap-dependent
  rates of convergence have been established thus far. This paper is devoted to revealing
  significantly better or as-yet-unknown theoretical properties of such solvers. We
  present a novel convergence analysis in a unified framework for three types of first-order
  Riemannian solvers, i.e., deterministic, vanilla stochastic, and stochastic with
  variance reduction, that are to find top-k eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix,
  in full generality. In particular, the issue of zero gaps between eigenvalues,  to
  the best of our knowledge for the first time, is explicitly considered for these
  solvers, which brings new understandings, e.g., the dependence of convergence on
  gaps other than the k-th one. We thus propose the concept of generalized k-th gap.
  Three types of solvers are proved to converge to a globally optimal solution at
  a global, generalized k-th gap-dependent, and linear or sub-linear rate.
