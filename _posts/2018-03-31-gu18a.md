title: Asynchronous Doubly Stochastic Group Regularized Learning
abstract: Group regularized learning problems (such as group Lasso)  are important  in
  machine learning.  The asynchronous parallel stochastic optimization algorithms
  have received huge attentions recently as handling large scale problems. However,
  existing asynchronous stochastic algorithms for solving  the group regularized learning
  problems   are not scalable enough simultaneously in sample size and feature dimensionality.  To
  address this challenging problem, in this paper, we propose a novel asynchronous
  doubly stochastic  proximal gradient algorithm with variance reduction (AsyDSPG+).
  To the best of our knowledge, AsyDSPG+ is the first asynchronous doubly stochastic  proximal
  gradient algorithm, which  can scale well with the large sample size and high feature
  dimensionality simultaneously. More importantly, we  provide a comprehensive convergence
  guarantee to AsyDSPG+. The experimental  results on various  large-scale real-world
  datasets not only confirm  the fast convergence of our new method, but also show
  that AsyDSPG+ scales better than the existing algorithms with the sample size and
  dimension simultaneously.
