title: 'Batch-Expansion Training: An Efficient Optimization Framework'
abstract: We propose Batch-Expansion Training (BET), a framework for running a batch
  optimizer on a gradually expanding dataset. As opposed to stochastic approaches,
  batches do not need to be resampled i.i.d. at every iteration, thus making BET more
  resource efficient in a distributed setting, and when disk-access is constrained.
  Moreover, BET can be easily paired with most batch optimizers, does not require
  any parameter-tuning, and compares favorably to existing stochastic and batch methods.
  We show that when the batch size grows exponentially with the number of outer iterations,
  BET achieves optimal O (1/epsilon) data-access convergence rate for strongly convex
  objectives. Experiments in parallel and distributed settings show that BET performs
  better than standard batch and stochastic approaches.
