title: Learning with Complex Loss Functions and Constraints
abstract: We develop a general approach for solving constrained classification problems,
  where the loss and constraints are defined in terms of a general function of the
  confusion matrix. We are able to handle complex, non-linear loss functions such
  as the F-measure, G-mean or H-mean, and constraints ranging from budget limits,
  to constraints for fairness, to bounds on complex evaluation metrics. Our approach
  builds on the framework of Narasimhan et al. (2015) for unconstrained classification
  with complex losses, and reduces the constrained learning problem to a sequence
  of cost-sensitive learning tasks. We provide algorithms for two broad families of
  problems, involving convex and fractional-convex losses, subject to convex constraints.
  Our algorithms are statistically consistent, generalize an existing approach for
  fair classification, and readily apply to multiclass problems. Experiments on a
  variety of tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our methods.
