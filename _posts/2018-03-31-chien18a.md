title: 'Community Detection in Hypergraphs: Optimal Statistical Limit and Efficient
  Algorithms'
abstract: In this paper, community detection in hypergraphs is explored. Under a generative
  hypergraph model called "d-wise hypergraph stochastic block model" (d-hSBM) which
  naturally extends the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) from graphs to d-uniform hypergraphs,
  the fundamental limit on the asymptotic minimax misclassified ratio is characterized.
  For proving the achievability, we propose a two-step polynomial time algorithm that
  provably achieves the fundamental limit in the sparse hypergraph regime. For proving
  the optimality, the lower bound of the minimax risk is set by finding a smaller
  parameter space which contains the most dominant error events, inspired by the analysis
  in the achievability part. It turns out that the minimax risk decays exponentially
  fast to zero as the number of nodes tends to infinity, and the rate function is
  a weighted combination of several divergence terms, each of which is the Renyi divergence
  of order 1/2 between two Bernoulli distributions. The Bernoulli distributions involved
  in the characterization of the rate function are those governing the random instantiation
  of hyperedges in d-hSBM. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data
  validate our theoretical finding.
