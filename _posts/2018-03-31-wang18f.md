title: Fast and Scalable Learning of Sparse Changes in High-Dimensional Gaussian Graphical
  Model Structure
abstract: We focus on the problem of estimating the change in the dependency structures
  of two $p$-dimensional Gaussian Graphical models (GGMs). Previous studies for sparse
  change estimation in GGMs involve expensive and difficult non-smooth optimization.
  We propose a novel method, DIFFEE for estimating DIFFerential networks via an Elementary
  Estimator under a high-dimensional situation. DIFFEE is solved through a faster
  and closed form solution that enables it to work in large-scale settings. We conduct
  a rigorous statistical analysis showing that surprisingly DIFFEE achieves the same
  asymptotic convergence rates as the state-of-the-art estimators that are much more
  difficult to compute. Our experimental results on multiple synthetic datasets and
  one real-world data about brain connectivity show strong performance improvements
  over baselines, as well as significant computational benefits.
