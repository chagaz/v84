title: Adaptive balancing of gradient and update computation times using global geometry
  and approximate subproblems
abstract: 'First-order optimization methods comprise two important primitives: i)
  the computation of gradient information and ii) the computation of the update that
  leads to the next iterate. In practice there is often a wide mismatch between the
  time required for the two steps, leading to underutilization of resources. In this
  work, we propose a new framework, Approx Composite Minimization (ACM) that uses
  approximate update steps to ensure balance between the two operations. The accuracy
  is adaptively chosen in an online fashion to take advantage of changing conditions.
  Our unified analysis for approximate composite minimization generalizes and extends
  previous work to new settings. Numerical experiments on Lasso regression and SVMs
  demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel scheme.'
