title: Learning Structural Weight Uncertainty for Sequential Decision-Making
abstract: Learning probability distributions on the weights of neural networks (NNs)
  has recently proven beneficial in many applications. Bayesian methods, such as Stein
  variational gradient descent (SVGD), offer an elegant framework to reason about
  NN model uncertainty. However, by assuming independent Gaussian priors for the individual
  NN weights (as often applied), SVGD does not impose prior knowledge that there is
  often structural information (dependence) among weights. We propose efficient posterior
  learning of structural weight uncertainty, within an SVGD framework, by employing
  matrix variate Gaussian priors on NN parameters. We further investigate the learned
  structural uncertainty in sequential decision-making problems, including contextual
  bandits and reinforcement learning. Experiments on several synthetic and real datasets
  indicate the superiority of our model, compared with state-of-the-art methods.
