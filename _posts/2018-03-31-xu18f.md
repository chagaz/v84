title: On the Statistical Efficiency of Compositional Nonparametric Prediction
abstract: In this paper, we propose a compositional nonparametric method in which
  a model is expressed as a labeled binary tree of $2k+1$ nodes, where each node is
  either a summation, a multiplication, or the application of one of the $q$ basis
  functions to one of the $p$ covariates. We show that in order to recover a labeled
  binary tree from a given dataset, the sufficient number of samples is $O(k\log(pq)+\log(k!))$,
  and the necessary number of samples is  $Î©(k\log (pq)-\log(k!))$. We further propose
  a greedy algorithm for regression in order to validate our theoretical findings
  through synthetic experiments.
