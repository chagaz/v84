title: 'Making Tree Ensembles Interpretable: A Bayesian Model Selection Approach'
abstract: Tree ensembles, such as random forests, are renowned for their high prediction
  performance. However, their interpretability is critically limited due to the enormous
  complexity. In this study, we propose a method to make a complex tree ensemble interpretable
  by simplifying the model. Specifically, we formalize the simplification of tree
  ensembles as a model selection problem. Given a complex tree ensemble, we aim at
  obtaining the simplest representation that is essentially equivalent to the original
  one. To this end, we derive a Bayesian model selection algorithm that optimizes
  the simplified model while maintaining the prediction performance. Our numerical
  experiments on several datasets showed that complicated tree ensembles were approximated
  interpretably.
