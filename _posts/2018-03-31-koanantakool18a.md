title: Communication-Avoiding Optimization Methods for Distributed Massive-Scale Sparse
  Inverse Covariance Estimation
abstract: Across a variety of scientific disciplines, sparse inverse covariance estimation
  is a popular tool for capturing the underlying dependency relationships in multivariate
  data. Unfortunately, most estimators are not scalable enough to handle the sizes
  of modern high-dimensional data sets (often on the order of terabytes), and assume
  Gaussian samples. To address these deficiencies, we introduce HP-CONCORD, a highly
  scalable optimization method for estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix based
  on a regularized pseudolikelihood framework, without assuming Gaussianity. Our parallel
  proximal gradient method uses a novel communication-avoiding linear algebra algorithm
  and runs across a multi-node cluster with up to 1k nodes (24k cores), achieving
  parallel scalability on problems with up to â‰ˆ819 billion parameters (1.28 million
  dimensions); even on a single node, HP-CONCORD demonstrates scalability, outperforming
  a state-of-the-art method. We also use HP-CONCORD to estimate the underlying dependency
  structure of the brain from fMRI data, and use the result to identify functional
  regions automatically. The results show good agreement with a clustering from the
  neuroscience literature.
