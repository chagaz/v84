title: On denoising modulo 1 samples of a function
abstract: 'Consider an unknown smooth function   $f: [0,1] →\mathbb{R}$, and say we
  are given $n$ noisy $\mod 1$ samples of $f$, i.e., $y_i = (f(x_i) + \eta_i)\mod
  1$ for  $x_i ∈[0,1]$,  where $\eta_i$ denotes noise. Given the samples $(x_i,y_i)_{i=1}^{n}$
  our goal is to recover smooth, robust estimates of the clean samples $f(x_i) \bmod
  1$. We formulate a natural approach for solving this problem which works with representations
  of mod  1 values over the unit circle. This amounts to solving a quadratically constrained
  quadratic program (QCQP) with non-convex constraints involving points lying on the
  unit circle. Our proposed approach is based on solving its relaxation which is a
  trust region subproblem, and hence solvable efficiently. We demonstrate its robustness
  to noise via extensive simulations on several synthetic examples, and provide a
  detailed theoretical analysis. '
