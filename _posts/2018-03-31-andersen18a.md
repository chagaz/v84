title: Bayesian Structure Learning for Dynamic Brain Connectivity
abstract: Human brain activity as measured by fMRI exhibits strong correlations between
  brain regions which are believed to vary over time. Importantly, dynamic connectivity
  has been linked to individual differences in physiology, psychology and behavior,
  and has shown promise as a biomarker for disease. The state of the art in computational
  neuroimaging is to estimate the brain networks as relatively short sliding window
  covariance matrices, which leads to high variance estimates, thereby resulting in
  high overall error.  This manuscript proposes a novel Bayesian model for dynamic
  brain connectivity. Motivated by the underlying neuroscience, the model estimates
  covariances which vary smoothly over time, with an instantaneous decomposition into
  a collection of spatially sparse components â€“ resulting in parsimonious and highly
  interpretable estimates of dynamic brain connectivity. Simulated results are presented
  to illustrate the performance of the model even when it is mis-specified. For real
  brain imaging data with unknown ground truth, in addition to qualitative evaluation,
  we devise a simple classification task which suggests that the estimated brain networks
  better capture the underlying structure.
