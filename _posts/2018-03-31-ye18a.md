title: 'HONES: A Fast and Tuning-free Homotopy Method For Online Newton Step'
abstract: In this article, we develop and analyze a homotopy continuation method,
  referred to as HONES , for solving the sequential generalized projections in Online
  Newton Step (Hazan et al., 2006b), as well as the generalized problem known as sequential
  standard quadratic programming. HONES is fast, tuning-free, error-free (up to machine
  error) and adaptive to the solution sparsity. This is confirmed by both careful
  theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data.
