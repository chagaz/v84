title: 'Turing: a language for flexible probabilistic inference'
abstract: 'Probabilistic programming promises to simplify and democratize probabilistic
  machine learning, but successful probabilistic programming systems require flexible,
  generic and efficient inference engines. In this work, we present a system called
  Turing for building MCMC algorithms for probabilistic programming inference. Turing
  has a very simple syntax and makes full use of the numerical capabilities in the
  Julia programming language, including all implemented probability distributions,
  and automatic differentiation. Turing supports a wide range of popular Monte Carlo
  algorithms, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), HMC with No-U-Turns (NUTS),
  Gibbs sampling, sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), and several particle MCMC (PMCMC)
  samplers. Most importantly, Turing inference is composable: it combines MCMC operations
  on subsets of variables, for example using a combination of an HMC engine and a
  particle Gibbs (PG) engine.  We explore several combinations of inference methods
  with the aim of finding approaches that are both efficient and universal, i.e. applicable
  to arbitrary probabilistic models. NUTSâ€”a popular variant of HMC that adapts Hamiltonian
  simulation path length automatically, although quite powerful for exploring differentiable
  target distributions, is however not universal. We identify some failure modes for
  the NUTS engine, and demonstrate that composition of PG (for discrete variables)
  and NUTS (for continuous variables) can be useful when the NUTS engine is either
  not applicable, or simply does not work well. Our aim is to present Turing and its
  composable inference engines to the world and encourage other researchers to build
  on this system to help advance the field of probabilistic machine learning. '
