title: Statistically Efficient Estimation for Non-Smooth Probability Densities
abstract: We investigate statistical efficiency of estimators for non-smooth density
  functions. The density estimation problem appears in various situations, and it
  is intensively used in statistics and machine learning. The statistical efficiencies
  of estimators, i.e., their convergence rates, play a central role in advanced statistical
  analysis. Although estimators and their convergence rates for smooth density functions
  are well investigated in the literature, those for non-smooth density functions
  remain elusive despite their importance in application fields. In this paper, we
  propose new estimators for non-smooth density functions by employing the notion
  of Szemeredi partitions from graph theory. We derive convergence rates of the proposed
  estimators. One of them has the optimal convergence rate in minimax sense, and the
  other has slightly worse convergence rate but runs in polynomial time. Experimental
  results support the theoretical performance of our estimators.
