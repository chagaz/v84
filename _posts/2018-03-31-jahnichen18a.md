title: Scalable Generalized Dynamic Topic Models
abstract: Dynamic topic models (DTMs) model the evolution of prevalent themes in literature,
  online media, and other forms of text over time. DTMs assume that word co-occurrence
  statistics change continuously and therefore impose continuous stochastic process
  priors on their model parameters. These dynamical priors make inference much harder
  than in regular topic models, and also limit scalability. In this paper, we present
  several new results around DTMs. First, we extend the class of tractable priors
  from Wiener processes to the generic class of Gaussian processes (GPs). This allows
  us to explore topics that develop smoothly over time, that have a long-term memory
  or are temporally concentrated (for event detection). Second, we show how to perform
  scalable approximate inference in these models based on ideas around stochastic
  variational inference and sparse Gaussian processes. This way we can train a rich
  family of DTMs to massive data. Our experiments on several large-scale datasets
  show that our generalized model allows us to find interesting patterns that were
  not accessible by previous approaches.
